Founded in 1819 as the Southern and Western Theological Seminary, it was originally intended as a seminary. Quickly realizing that most students were unprepared for graduate study in theology, its founder, the Rev. Isaac Anderson, began to offer preparatory “literary” courses. In 1842, the charter from the state of Tennessee was granted for “Maryville College.” Following the disruption of the Civil War, the College reopened and moved to its present location. Through more than two hundred years, the College has withstood major wars, economic upheavals and changing social realities. By adapting to its shifting environments, the College has remained a strong and vibrant academic community respected for academic excellence and sincerity in implementing its purpose. Today, Maryville College is a nationally ranked institution known for educating students to be giving citizens and gifted leaders, inspiring them to study everything, so that they are prepared for anything – to address any problem, engage with any audience and launch successful careers right away. Located in Maryville, Tennessee, between the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the city of Knoxville, Maryville College offers nearly 1,200 students from around the world both the beauty of a rural setting and the advantages of an urban center, as well as more than 70 majors, minors and pre-professional programs. Students receive career preparation from their first day on campus to their last. The College’s more than 10,000 alumni are living life strong of mind and brave of heart and are prepared, in the words of our Presbyterian founder, to “do good on the largest possible scale.” Academic Calendar Academic Calendar A Church-Related College for the 21st Century Maryville College proudly claims its Presbyterian heritage; from the time the Rev. Isaac Anderson founded the college in 1819 to train ministers for the frontier of the United States until today, when we enjoy a rich diversity of students. While holding strongly to its Presbyterian connection, the College honors and welcomes students from all backgrounds and religious traditions. The practice of faith and learning at Maryville College connects scholarship, worship, and community, by giving each student a place to explore, a place to grow and a place to commit. The whole community is invited to worship at the Center for Campus Ministry each Tuesday at 1:15. Faith and Learning Statement Maryville College, related by voluntary covenant to the Presbyterian Church (USA), seeks to provide a quality liberal arts education that encourages the search for truth in all areas of life. The Presbyterian tradition, with its historical emphasis on educating both clergy and laity, provides the theological framework for such an institution of higher education. Reformed theology places all reality in relationship to God and thus finds all subject matters worthy of study, while acknowledging, in an attitude of humility, that all human answers are at best provisional. The church “Reformed and always reforming” encourages the sort of ongoing openness to revisiting the questions and revising the answers that a true liberal arts education invites. As a church-related liberal arts college, Maryville strives to provide a quality education by creating an environment that: • Fosters a welcoming and diverse community of belonging for all; • Provides students with the tools to critically engage College Information| 9 spiritual, philosophical, and ethical issues; • Embraces rigorous exploration of differing points of view both inside and outside the classroom; • Challenges all persons to work for justice, strive for peace, and care for creation; and • Offers opportunities for worship and engagement in a community of scholarship, respect, and integrity. Maryville College does not presume that all members of the community will share the institution’s Presbyterian or Christian convictions; instead, we recognize that the life of the College is enriched by each person present in our midst. As the College’s Statement of Purpose says, we “must listen attentively and humbly to all human voices so that [we] may hear the call of God no matter how God may speak.” The goal of a Maryville education is the search for truth, wherever it may be found, and the ability to grapple with life’s ultimate questions of faith, meaning, and value. Reflecting our commitment to prepare students for lives of citizenship, service, and leadership, Maryville College provides a nurturing environment that equips students with resources to help them build a mature and credible faith for an increasingly complex world.

Charge Reduction Policy College registration is considered a contract binding the student for charges for the entire semester. However, if it becomes necessary for a student to officially withdraw from school, specific actions must be taken. See the Withdrawal (p. 60) section for detailed instructions. Briefly, students must complete and return a withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office to be officially withdrawn. If a student is unable to withdraw in person, they may do so by notifying the Registrar’s Office and the Office of Student Affairs in writing. The withdrawal date is defined as follows: 1.

SPECIAL RULE- Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the institution determines that a student did not begin the withdrawal process, or otherwise notify the institution of the intent to withdraw, due to illness, accident, grievous personal loss, or other such circumstances beyond the student's control, the institution may determine the appropriate withdrawal date. Complete Withdrawal from School Reductions will be computed on total charges for tuition, room, and board. There will be no reductions of student fees of any type, including course fees after the first day of class. Students are expected to vacate the residence halls immediately upon withdrawal from College.

There will be no refunds for partial week room charges. • Within 3 calendar days of scheduled session start date – 75 percent charge reduction; • Within 6 calendar days of scheduled session start date – 50 percent charge reduction; • Within 10 calendar days of scheduled session start 16| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 date – 25 percent charge reduction; • After 10 calendar days of the scheduled session start date – no charge reduction will be granted. 5 Week or Longer Summer Session For a student who formally withdraws from College during a 5 week or longer summer session, the session’s tuition charges will be reduced in accordance with the following schedule: Summer room rates are charged by the week. There will be no refunds for partial week room charges. • Within 7 calendar days of scheduled session start date – 75 percent charge reduction; • Within 14 calendar days of scheduled session start date – 50 percent charge reduction; • Within 21 calendar days of scheduled session start date – 25 percent charge reduction; • After 21 calendar days of the scheduled session start date – no charge reduction will be granted. Summer room rates are charged by the week. There will be no refunds for partial week room charges. There are no board meal plans offered in the summer. No reduction of charges will be granted to a student suspended or expelled for disciplinary reasons. When a student withdraws from school, and has received federal student aid for the semester, the Title IV awards will be recalculated in accordance with the “Return of Title IV Funds” federal regulations. State, Institutional and Non- Institutional financial aid will be refunded based on the charge reduction schedule listed above. After 30 calendar days of the scheduled semester start date, there will be no pro-rated State, Institutional, or Non-Institutional financial aid reductions. A copy of the policy is available in the Financial Aid Office upon request. Complete withdrawal from school may cause a balance due on the student’s account. Leaving the College without officially withdrawing may result in a student forfeiting all financial aid and, thus, becoming responsible for the entire balance. Acadeum Online Courses The online courses offered through Acadeum College Consortium are currently priced the same as summer school courses. Payment for these courses is due in full three business days before the course start date or the student will be dropped from the course. Additionally, no tuition refunds will be provided after the course drop date. Approved Medical Withdrawals Reductions will be computed on total charges for tuition, room, and board. There will be no reductions of student fees of any type. Students are expected to vacate the residence halls immediately upon withdrawal from College. Full-time students who withdraw from individual classes after the drop/add period will receive no charge reduction. For purposes of interpreting this policy, the pro-rata charge reduction percentage is determined by the Federal Financial Aid policy and the percentage is calculated by the Business Office based on the withdrawal date. No charge reduction will be given after the 60% period of enrollment for the semester or term. When a student’s charges are reduced, Federal, State, Institutional and Non-Institutional Aid will be adjusted in accordance with the regulations governing the respective programs. Please contact the Financial Aid Office for current regulations concerning these programs. Complete withdrawal from school may cause a balance due on the student’s account. Leaving the College without officially withdrawing may result in a student forfeiting all financial aid and, thus, becoming responsible for the entire balance. For information on how to request a medical withdrawal from the College, see the Medical Withdrawal (p. 63) section of the Catalog. Students Moving Off-Campus If a student is approved to leave College housing after the census date, the room charge will be pro-rated to reflect the number of days the student used the room. Once students have been approved to move off campus by the Vice President & Dean of Students, the office of Residence Life will provide student notification of approval to move off campus. The Office of Residence Life will notify the Bursar of the official approval date. The Bursar will pro- rate the charges based on the number of days the student lived in the residence hall. In addition, the student’s institutional financial aid will be pro-rated to match the number of days the student lived in a residence hall. Please refer back to the Fall and Spring Semester Reduction Rates for the charge reduction percentages. There will be NO refunds for room changes after 30 days from the start of classes. Meal Plan change requests are not accepted after the census date, which is 10 days after classes begin. If there is an extraordinary circumstance in which a student needs to request a meal plan change or refunds after that date, they Admissions and Financial Aid| 17 must do so in writing. Any change after the census date will require approval from the Vice President For Finance. These refund requests are handled on a case by case basis and typically cannot be approved without appropriate documentation from the student as to why the refund is being requested. Plus, Extra, or Extra Plus Flex Dollars will not be refunded or reduced at any time. Administrative Withdrawal Due to Non-Payment College-Initiated Administrative Withdrawal for Non- Payment I. Statement of Policy Maryville College administration reserves the right to withdraw a student at any point in the semester due to non- payment of their student account. II. College-Initiated Administrative Withdrawal for Non-Payment The college may administratively withdraw a student from classes, remove a student from residence halls, and/or require conditions for continued enrollment when one of the following transpires: • A student fails to submit payment as indicated on a college approved deferment agreement. • A student misses at least 3 payments on an outside payment plan and the payment plan is cancelled. In these circumstances above, the Bursar in collaboration with the Controller and Vice President of Finance may administratively withdraw a student from classes, remove the student from Residence Halls, and/or place conditions on the student’s continued enrollment. The student will receive opportunity to pay in full or establish suitable payment arrangements with the Bursar’s Office. All notification to the student will be in writing with payment options available and a set deadline for a required response. Students that do not respond by the established deadline will be Administratively Withdrawn as of that date. III. Impact of College Initiated Administrative Withdrawal for Non-Payment A. Students that are withdrawn due to College Initiated Administrative Withdrawal for Non-Payment will either have their schedule dropped or receive a “W” for all courses attempted during the semester. The “W” will be reflected on the student’s official transcript. B. Students that are withdrawn are subject to the College’s Charge Reduction Policy (p. 15). C. Students that wish to return to Maryville College the next semester will be required to apply for readmission. All previous balances must be paid in full prior to readmission to the College. D. A Balance Hold will be placed on the student’s account until any balance is paid in full. This will prohibit viewing of grades and registration for classes. E. Students that are administratively withdrawn due to non-payment and are residential students will have 24 hours to vacate their residence hall and return any keys to the College Residence Life staff. Students needing more than 24 hours to vacate their Residence Hall can work with the Residence Life staff for assistance. IV. Responsible Official(s) The officials responsible for this policy are the VP of Finance, Controller, and Bursar. Questions can be addressed to the Business Office. Calculating Withdrawal Refunds When students register for courses, the College assumes full-year enrollment, provides facilities, and executes contracts to provide educational services for the entire year. Federally mandated refund calculations apply when students withdraw. When recipients of student financial aid withdraw, refunds must be returned to various financial aid programs as well as the individual student. Students who receive financial aid, and are subject to a refund, might not be eligible for a cash refund. At times, refunds may be reapplied to a loan, thus reducing student indebtedness. Upon withdrawal, any cash refunds due will be processed as quickly as possible, but requires a minimum of 14 days. Refunds are only calculated and based on charges for tuition, fees, room, and board. No refunds will be made to students unless they withdraw from all courses in which they are registered. Charges and financial aid for students who change from full-time to part-time status during the drop/add period at the beginning of the semester will be revised on that basis. Students may use the first week of the semester to finalize registered courses without incurring additional fees. No refund is given for students who change from full-time to part-time status after the first ten days of the semester. Students defined as part-time who withdraw after the drop/add period will receive refunds under the same policy as full-time students. For refund purposes, the date of withdrawal is the date that the withdrawal process is initiated, or College personnel are provided with notification of intent to withdraw. The withdrawal date for students who stop attending classes 18| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 without formally withdrawing is based on the last date of academic activity. If a date cannot be determined, the midpoint of the semester may be used as the date of withdrawal. The act of attending any class for a given semester prior to withdrawing is considered to constitute a requirement for withdrawal calculations. Students who withdraw from all classes or who stop attending classes, but who receive permission to live in the residence hall, will be charged room and board for the time they remain in the residence hall and on a meal plan. The amount of Title IV and other aid that must be returned to a program source will be calculated and charges will be adjusted by the aid earned in order to determine the total amount for which a student is responsible for payment to the College. Return of Title IV Funds Calculation Return of Title IV funds occurs when a student receives federal funds and then officially drops, withdraws or ceases attendance, with or without notifying the school. The amount of unearned Title IV aid must be calculated. This is determined by multiplying the percentage of term (based on calendar days including weekends and holidays) by the Title IV aid received. All types of Federal Aid– including loans–are used in this calculation. College work- study funds which have been earned will not be included. If a student attended more than 60% of the term, no return of funds will be required. After the amount of Title IV aid to be returned is calculated, a determination of how much must be returned by the institution and how much must be returned by the student will be made. Any funds returned by the institution are credited in the order of loans, (Unsubsidized Direct, Subsidized Direct, PLUS) Pell Grant, FSEOG Grant and other Title IV aid. If the student has any loans (Direct and PLUS) which have been used in the calculation, this obligation will be due and payable by the terms of the promissory note. Any return of Title IV funds required by a student must be paid prior to receiving additional financial aid at Maryville College or any other institution. Any funds returned by the institution on the student’s behalf must be repaid by the student to the College prior to receiving grades or attempting to register for subsequent terms. A complete and detailed explanation of this policy, along with examples, is available at the Financial Aid Office. A copy of the Final Return to Title IV Refund Calculation form may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office for review. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students must maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) while pursuing a degree in order to receive financial assistance from federal and state programs. These programs include Federal Pell Grant, Federal Direct Loans, Federal Parent PLUS Loan, Federal Work Study, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal TEACH Grant, and the Tennessee Student Assistance Award. SAP is reviewed at the end of each semester; fall, spring and summer. At each review, students must meet the GPA requirements applicable to their academic standing. Students must also complete at least 66.66% of all classes attempted. Finally, students must complete their degree within 150% of the published program length as stated in this Catalog. Failure to meet these requirements may result in suspension of federal and state financial aid as stated. Note: Grades of F, I, U, or W are considered attempted but not meeting progress standards for the purposes of financial aid and are counted for SAP. If SAP is not being met, the following process will be taken. All notifications will be sent to the student’s Maryville College email address and the student’s permanent address as noted on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Financial Aid Warning – Students who fail to meet SAP for the first time (excluding students that have attempted 150% of the credits required for their degree) will be placed in a Warning Status for one term and are expected to meet SAP requirements by the end of the following term of enrollment. Students who fail to meet SAP requirements at the end of the Warning Status will be placed on financial aid suspension. Financial Aid Suspension – Students who do not meet the terms of their academic plan, the cumulative grade point average standard, and/or Pace will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. Students on Financial Aid Suspension are not eligible to receive any Title IV Aid as outlined above and all aid will be cancelled for future semesters until the student has regained SAP. Students may appeal this suspension to the Maryville College Appeals Committee. Financial Aid Probation (appeal approved) – Students who have successfully appealed their financial aid suspension are placed on Financial Aid Probation. Students on Financial Aid Probation are eligible to receive financial aid for one semester, after which they must meet SAP or meet the requirements outlined in their academic plan as Admissions and Financial Aid| 19 approved by the Maryville College Appeals Committee. Federal regulations allow for certain cases in which the school may waive the standards for satisfactory academic progress. Specifically, if a student fails to be in compliance with one or more of the satisfactory academic progress components due to events beyond the student’s control, such as extended illness, serious illness or death in the immediate family, or other significant trauma, and if such mitigating circumstances can be appropriately documented for the specific term(s) in which the deficiency occurred. Appeals must be made in writing to the Maryville College Financial Aid Office and the student should include appropriate supporting documentation. The appeal should be well presented with attention to spelling and grammar, and it should outline the extenuating circumstances that contributed to the student’s inability to meet SAP standards and what has changed that will allow the student to meet SAP at the next evaluation. A student whose appeal is approved will be required to follow an Academic Plan developed by the Maryville College Financial Aid Office. Failure to successfully complete all conditions during the probationary period (as defined in the academic plan) will result in loss of financial aid eligibility. Institutional, State, and Outside Funds Refund Calculation Maryville College follows an institutional policy for reductions to Institutional, State and outside financial aid. Aid will be refunded based on the charge reduction schedule (please refer to the Charge Reduction Policy located on the College website. After 30 calendar days of the scheduled semester start date, there will be no pro-rated Institutional, State, or outside aid determined. After the refund calculations have been completed, any remaining outstanding charges will be added to the final bill. Financial Aid Most Maryville College students receive scholarship and/or need-based assistance. Maryville College merit scholarships are renewable provided the student maintains an appropriate minimum grade point average (GPA) and/or participation in a program or performance group. Other program requirements can be clarified by the coordinator of the program in which the student participates. Eligibility for need based aid (i.e. Federal Pell Grants, Tennessee Student Assistance Awards [TSAA], Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants [SEOG] and/or MC Grant) or student loans is determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students must complete the FAFSA as soon as possible after October 1. TSAA is awarded on a first-come- first served basis. MC students who file late for the FAFSA may miss out on valuable grant assistance from the state. Students may view their personal financial aid information and accept their financial aid on the MC Online Financial Aid System at https://finaid.maryvillecollege.edu/NetPartnerStudent. Questions concerning financial aid or the HOPE/TELS scholarship program should be directed to the Financial Aid Office, Fayerweather Hall, Office 141. TELS (Tennessee Educational Lottery Program) Tennessee residents awarded the Tennessee HOPE Scholarship must be aware of the specific requirements in order to retain their scholarship. Students must file a FAFSA each year to ensure access to the scholarship. The financial aid office must review renewal eligibility for the scholarship when students have crossed a benchmark. The benchmarks are 24, 48, 72, and 96 TELS attempted credit hours, with an additional benchmark at 120 TELS attempted credit hours for degrees that require more than the standard 120 credit hours to complete requirements. A scholarship recipient must: • After 24 and 48 TELS attempted credit hours, have a minimum TELS GPA of 2.75; OR • After 72, 96, 120 TELS attempted credit hours, have a minimum TELS GPA of 3.00; OR • If after 72, 96, 120 TELS attempted credit hours, the student has a 2.75 – 2.99 TELS GPA, the student may continue to receive the scholarship on a provisional basis if they earned a semester GPA of at least a 3.0 for the most recently completed semester. Students on the provisional track must earn at least a 3.0 GPA in each subsequent term to maintain eligibility; AND • Maintain continuous enrollment from one term to the next, excluding summer; AND • Maintain enrollment at the same level for the full term (i.e. not drop below full-time status) • Maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. The TELS GPA includes all grades for college courses completed after graduation from high school. TELS 20| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 attempted hours include courses in which students enroll but withdraw after the official drop/add date, remedial coursework, and any courses taken at another higher education institution. The TELS program provides a Repeat Provision that offers students the ability to repeat one course to improve their TELS GPA. A Regain Provision exists that allows students to regain their HOPE/TELS at subsequent benchmarks. Each of these provisions may be used once. Students should consult with the financial aid office for a more detailed explanation or assistance in interpreting the rules of the programs. Tennessee HOPE Scholarship Termination Criteria Students may receive the HOPE Scholarship until the first of the following terminating events: • Student earns a baccalaureate degree; or • Five years have passed from the date of initial enrollment at any postsecondary institution; or • Student has attempted the number of semester hours required to earn degree. Students with a documented medical condition, certified by a licensed physician, that restricts their ability to maintain a full-time schedule, may appeal to the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC) for an extension to the five-year limit. However, they must continue to meet all applicable academic and nonacademic requirements for the HOPE Scholarship.

The form is located on the main Safety & Security webpage under Forms – CSA Clery Act Reporting Form. Additional safety information can be found at: Campus Safety, Security and Emergencies Human and Animal Research Approval Research projects involving human participants and animal subjects are required by federal law to undergo prescribed review. Studies involving humans (including questionnaires and surveys; interviews and focus groups; cognitive and perceptual experiments; analysis of specimens; or other research involving intervention or interaction with human subjects or the collection of identifiable information from human subjects) are reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Studies involving animals are reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Faculty, staff, and students who plan to conduct such research must follow the respective guidelines set forth by Maryville College. In the case of Senior Study research, primary responsibility of submitting an IRB or IACUC proposal resides with the student. Faculty advisors must review student approval documents prior to student submission to the IRB for approval. Once the student submits the approved document to the IRB, advisors register their final approval of the research plan. Faculty advisors are responsible for ensuring that appropriate approval has been met before data collection begins. Serious violations of these guidelines may be referred to the Academic Integrity Board (p. 43). IRB guidelines and procedures are available on the Tartan. Institutional Review Board The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is responsible for reviewing research projects that involve human participants to ensure ethical and legal research standards are upheld. All researchers submitting applications— including faculty supervising student research—must demonstrate an understanding of the ethical and legal guidelines governing the use of human participants by completing an IRB-approved training prior to the approval of any human subjects research. Maryville College adheres to following three fundamental ethical principles for all human subjects’ research outlined in the “Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research” also known as the Belmont Report: • Respect for persons • Beneficence • Justice In addition, to the three principles above, human subjects research standards also include: • Research is supported by sound rationale and purpose; • Participants are not placed at undue risk; • Training and experience of researchers is adequate; • Participants are not coerced and provide informed consent for their participation; • Participants’ privacy and reputation are protected; • Applicants intending to work with protected populations should expect a longer review process; • Federal guidelines and safeguards are met; • Additional standards, requirements, and safeguards for research conducted internationally are required; and • Measures are taken to protect the College and researcher from complaints due to incomplete material, poor quality of research materials, and/or unclear instructions. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Research projects involving animal subjects are required by federal law to undergo prescribed review. Studies involving animals are reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Faculty, staff, and students who plan to conduct such research must follow the respective guidelines set forth by Maryville College. In College Policies| 23 the case of Senior Study research, primary responsibility of submitting an IACUC proposal resides with the student. Faculty advisors must review student approval documents prior to student submission to the IACUC for approval; Once the student submits the approved document to the IACUC, advisors register their final approval of the research plan. Faculty advisors are responsible for ensuring that appropriate approval has been met before data collection begins. Serious violations of these guidelines may be referred to the Academic Integrity (p. 41). IACUC guidelines and procedures are available from members of the IACUC. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is responsible for reviewing research projects that involve animal subjects to ensure federal research standards are upheld. Issues considered include: • Research is supported by sound rationale and purpose; • Numbers of subjects in individual projects is justified; • Training of researchers is adequate; • Federal guidelines and safeguards are met; • Additional standards, requirements, and safeguards for research conducted internationally are required; and • Measures are taken to protect the college and researcher from complaints due to improper procedures. Intellectual Property Introduction The faculty, staff, and Board of Directors at Maryville College encourage scholarship, creativity, and innovation that may result in the creation of intellectual property. The purpose of this Intellectual Property Policy is to establish mutual understanding of ownership, rights, and responsibilities related to the development, production, dissemination, and sale of intellectual property created by full-time and part-time Maryville College faculty, staff, and students. Definition of Intellectual Property For the purpose of this policy, the term “intellectual property” includes, but is not limited to, works of authorship inclusive of all mediums of expression (related to copyrights) and inventions and discoveries (related to patents). Ownership of Intellectual Property In most circumstances, the faculty member, student or staff member who creates the intellectual property has sole and exclusive ownership rights related to its sale, transfer, or use. In the development of intellectual property, the author/creator is responsible for obtaining permission or authorization for any use of copyrighted material or trademark (including that of the College) that may be included within the work itself. Following AAUP guidelines, there are certain situations in which Maryville College may claim ownership of intellectual property created by faculty, students, or staff. These situations include: • Works that are “made for hire,” created as a specific requirement of employment, as an assigned job duty, or in completion of a course assignment. (Note that a work is not necessarily classified as “made for hire” on the basis of use of College resources, facilities, or materials that are traditionally and commonly available to faculty and other members of the College community). • Negotiated contracts in which the author/creator has transferred or specified, in writing, a portion of ownership to the College, and • “Joint works” as described in the Copyright Act, where the institution can be considered a co-author.” The College is entitled to joint ownership in situations where it has contributed specialized services and facilities to the production of the work that goes beyond what is traditionally provided to faculty members generally. College resources include but are not limited to: College funds, supplies, computer resources, learning resources, equipment, software, the College name, personal position or status within the College, course enrollment, and/or College personnel. Such arrangements for joint ownership should be agreed to in writing, in advance of the creation of the intellectual property, and are in full conformance with other provisions of this agreement. To avoid conflicts related to ownership of intellectual property, faculty, staff and students should be aware that intellectual property issues may arise as a result of their work and should meet with the appropriate Vice President to establish a mutually agreeable understanding of 24| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 ownership issues prior to its creation. This understanding is to be set forth in writing and signed by all parties who may have reason to believe that they would have some rights of ownership. This agreement should clearly set out the specific ownership or co-ownership arrangements between the creator and the College and is to be signed by the appropriate Vice President. In situations where an external party provides support or sponsorship in the form of a grant, contract, or other agreement, ownership of the intellectual property should be clearly negotiated prior to initiating the work. In such cases, the College may be allocated some rights of ownership. Responsibility for exploring procedural rules and ownership guidelines of granting agencies or individuals lies with the person or persons who will be creating the intellectual property. In situations where the individual or granting agency does not address the ownership issue, the guidelines and rules set forth in this document will prevail. Copyrights, patents, and other documents and contracts related to ownership of intellectual property are filed in the Maryville College Business Office. Written agreements of individual arrangements made between faculty, students and or staff members who create intellectual property and the Vice President under whose direction the activity or intellectual property is associated are to be completed and filed in the office of the appropriate Vice President and in the Business Office. The College will be primarily responsible for oversight and protection of intellectual property that is jointly owned by the College and its faculty, staff or students. Use of Intellectual Property Much of the creative work at Maryville College that has the potential for being designated as intellectual property relates to material utilized by the College for educational and administrative purposes. As members of the College community, faculty, student, and staff creators agree that the College is allowed to use the works without charge in its ongoing operations. Such arrangements enable the College to operate efficiently without undue infringement on the creators’ right of ownership. It is understood that this use will be limited to non-revenue purposes. Departures from this use agreement are to be incorporated into any agreement that transfers copyright/ownership to a publisher or other entity. Materials such as course syllabi, assignments, and examinations etc. that are created for ordinary use in Maryville College classrooms remain the intellectual property of the faculty creator. However, ongoing permission for the College to use these materials for internal use is assumed unless prior limitations for their use by the College are made in writing. Students, likewise, remain the owner of intellectual property they create as a part of their educational productivity (term papers, projects, senior study, etc.). It is also assumed that the College has ongoing permission to use these materials as examples of its students’ work and for curricular or program assessment unless prior limitations for their use are made in writing. Distribution of Revenue The sole owner of intellectual property, whether faculty member, student, staff member, or the College, is entitled to any proceeds of the sale of the property and is entitled to distribute or expend funds associated with those proceeds at will. In situations where there are multiple creators or owners, proceeds are to be distributed in accordance with the allocations as negotiated by the parties at the inception of the project. Should conflict arise from situations where allocations are unclear, or were never negotiated, the allocation will be decided upon according to the dispute resolution process outlined below. Future Negotiations and Dispute Resolution Due to the changing nature of intellectual property rights, contracts, and policies within higher education, the College recognizes the need to create processes for review and renegotiation of the intellectual property policy as well as the need to designate a process whereby disputes related to intellectual property can be resolved. Because faculty members are most closely associated with activities that can result in creation of intellectual property, responsibility for intellectual property policy review and revision rests with the Academic Dean (or designee) in consultation with the Faculty Personnel Standards Committee. Disputes related to ownership of intellectual property are referred to the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee who, upon receipt of an appeal, will create an Ad Hoc Committee to hear the dispute and to render a decision. The composition of the Ad Hoc Committee will consist of three members of the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee chosen by vote of that committee and two staff members or administrators appointed by the President of the College. None of the three faculty members of the Ad Hoc Committee should be a member of the same academic division as any faculty member included in the dispute. In situations where there are claims of ownership that affect multiple academic divisions such that there are not three College Policies| 25 faculty from unrelated divisions elected to the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee, the Dean of the College will appoint the needed number of faculty members to serve on the Ad Hoc Committee. The Ad Hoc Committee will elect its own convener and recorder and will follow the hearing procedures for the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee as published in the Faculty Handbook. The committee will gather information, hear arguments, review materials, and may consult legal counsel. Ultimately it will make a decision regarding the rights, ownership, management, and other aspects associated with the intellectual property in dispute. Full consideration will be given by the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiating an acceptable compromise among the parties throughout the dispute procedure. In cases where the parties disagree with the Ad Hoc Committee decision, they may pursue external legal remedy. Any portion of the Intellectual Property Policy that is prohibited or deemed unlawful will be invalidated without effect on the remaining provisions set forth in the policy. Approved 2009 Student Grievance Procedure In the spirit of the Maryville College Statement of Purpose, the College sees itself as a \"community of learning that includes persons with a variety of interests, backgrounds, beliefs and nationalities.\" Such differences in attitude and perspective may, at times, result in problems or situations that warrant further institutional review and intervention. Procedures are in place for appeals of various College policies. Students should refer to the appropriate section of this catalog related to specific appeal processes related to grades, suspension, financial aid, disability service, judicial sanctions, and sexual grievances. Filing a Formal Complaint In an effort to provide students with an appropriate and effective response to situations not otherwise addressed in specific appeal processes, students should send a written explanation of their concern/complaint to the appropriate College official for review and resolution.

Ongoing programs include the Global+ Program, International Education Month, Global Connections Host Family program, the iMentor program, and two affiliated organizations: the Global Citizenship Organization (GCO) and Study Abroad Ambassadors (SAA). Global+ Program The Maryville College Global+ program is designed to increase global/intercultural competencies across the curriculum and provide the opportunity for every student Student Resources| 31 to incorporate a significant global component into their degree through Globally-focused degrees (International Business (p. 126), International Studies (p. 127), Spanish (p. 147) & TESL (p. 151)) Global+ courses (p. 71) and the Global+ Certificate program (p. 71). More information on the Certificate program can be found in the Program of Study Global+ Certificate Program (p. 71) section of the catalog Community-Engaged and Experiential Learning Community-Engaged Learning Maryville College has a long history among a robust network of agencies and organizations that work together to address community-based needs and utilize assets related to education, housing, health, hunger, interpersonal well-being, and the environment. Community-engaged learning involves addressing critical social issues and working collaboratively, with our community partners, towards the common good. Demonstrated through varied community-based research, scholarship, academic coursework, and service, Maryville College values the expertise, unique perspectives, and resources shared by our community partners. Community-Engaged Courses Community-engaged (CE) courses involve collaboration between faculty and students with our surrounding communities (local, regional/state, national, global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity. With community-engaged experiences, students find meaning and understanding and create impact in a real-world context; engage with diverse populations; apply new ways of thinking, work in teams, and solve problems; reflect, make connections, and challenge theoretical constructs; and build interpersonal and professional skills. Seen in the course descriptions of Self-Service’s course listings, a course with a Community Engagement (CE) designation meets the following four criteria: 1. connects a student’s disciplinary concepts with the community 2. requires students to reflect critically and are assessed based on academic competencies 3. integrates into the course and required of all students 4. involves collaboration with community partner(s) with reciprocal value for students and community Co-Curricular Community Engagement Opportunities In addition to CE courses, Maryville College offers numerous opportunities for students to become involved in community-based experiences outside of the classroom. Further information about community engagement at Maryville College can be found in the Student Life (p. 28) section of the catalog. Education Abroad See separate section under Student Resources on Education Abroad (p. 35) for comprehensive information on international opportunities. Experiential Learning Experiential education emphasizes guided activity as a primary mode of learning. It often takes place outside the conventional setting of a classroom, library, or laboratory and typically does not take place at a study desk. While mastery of information, understanding of expert opinion and cognitive learning are not ignored, effective change and growth is stressed. By exposing students to unfamiliar tasks and environments, experiential learning encourages mental and emotional adjustments and promotes the development of new skills and attitudes. It has as a principal goal the creation of sense of achievement, personal competence, and self-reliance. Experiential learning begins with concrete experience, but it does not stop there. It also involves an important element of reflection, an effort to develop a clear view of what one is doing and to assess its value. These observations and reflections should lead learners to new generalizations and concepts, fresh understandings of the world and oneself, and some enhancement of ability. Subsequently, new learning should be tested and refined in a different situation or additional experiences. At its best, experiential learning deepens the learners’ sensitivity to social and physical surroundings and encourages them to use senses and wits more fully. Thus it affords powerful opportunities for holistic learning. An “experiential education” course has the following characteristics: 1. It involves active and sustained participation by students. 2. It is a kind of experience that students have not had before. 32| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 3. It requires students not only to do something new but to stand back from the activity, assess its significance, and draw conclusions about it. 4. It provides opportunities to test these conclusions (or in the case of a skill-oriented course, to demonstrate increased mastery.) 5. It has as a major goal some modification in attitude or outlook, some change in personal perspective, and some deepening of insight regarding oneself and others or oneself and the world. Within the guidelines, experiential education courses are quite diverse in type. They include exploring a creative process, developing new physical skills, living for a time in an alien setting, or trying out a field through a “hands-on” approach. Courses having to do with service projects, life- enhancing activities, or new leisure skills and interests are especially appropriate. Some experiential learning courses assess fees that vary with particular offerings each year. Internships Internships are available in all major fields and provide excellent opportunities to gain practical experience in field settings. Details on internships may be found in the section of this catalog headed Academic Procedures and Regulations (see Internships (p. 58)) and under the course listings for academic fields. Mountain Challenge The Mountain Challenge program takes students outdoors. Area mountains, lakes, rivers, and woods provide the setting. The seasons, each one distinct in its own right, provide the agenda. In the fall and winter it may be panoramic views of changing leaves high in the mountains or cold mountain mornings shared with fellow travelers. Spring and summer may bring trips to appreciate the wildlife and beautiful plant life of the mountains. The agenda might include hiking, rock climbing canoeing on one of the beautiful area lakes, or climbing the Alpine Tower. Whatever the situation, the Mountain Challenge program is a chance to face challenges head on, to struggle through some difficult and unfamiliar tasks, and to experience the thrill of achievement. The Mountain Challenge program is an opportunity for people to explore the self while exploring the outdoors. Many of the events in the Mountain Challenge program require neither experience nor special equipment. The only requirements for these events are a willingness to try new experiences and a commitment to do ones best. Some events in the program do require experience and/or proper equipment. Experience can be gained through participation in other program events, and the College will supply needed equipment. Interested persons may sign up for Mountain Challenge trips at Crawford House. Students who participate in five different Mountain Challenge events may register to receive one (1) hour of PHR activity credit. Up to three (3) hours of PHR credit can be earned through Mountain Challenge. Various Mountain Challenge activities include: • Alpine Tower • Bicycle Trips • Caving • Camp 4 – Outdoor Fitness Activities • Hiking • Map and Compass • Mountain Trips and Expeditions • Outdoor or Environmental Related Service Projects • Paddling Trips • Rafting • Ropes Courses The schedule for open trips has current information for upcoming activities. Nonprofit Leadership Alliance The Nonprofit Leadership Alliance program affords opportunities for a variety of internships in nonprofit organizations, organizations that focus on environmental interests, and international non-governmental organizations.

Disability Resources & Accessibility Disability Resources & Accessibility Disability Resources & Accessibility seeks to meet the needs of students with documented disabilities by providing reasonable accommodations through an interactive process, assisting students in becoming self- advocates while supporting their curricular and co- curricular activities at college. Students are responsible for disclosing their disability and requesting accommodations by completing the registration form & providing current documentation of the disability. Disability Resources & Accessibility is committed to working with students, staff, and faculty in developing and implementing the most appropriate strategies for a successful learning experience while maintaining the academic standards and integrity of the mission of the College. Disability Resources & Accessibility Procedures The steps to obtain services through Disability Resources & Accessibility are described below: 1. Admission to Maryville College Students must be admitted to Maryville College before receiving services through Disability Resources & Accessibility. See the Admissions and Financial Aid section (p. 5) of the Maryville College catalog for required admission standards. 2. Registration for Services Students are responsible for disclosing a disability and requesting accommodations. Students must complete the registration for services and provide documentation which supports the request for reasonable accommodations for the disability. Registration form and documentation guidelines are located online at www.maryvillecollege.edu/disability. 34| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 3. Determination of Eligibility With guidance from the Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD), the Office of Disability Resources and Accessibility considers the following evidence for determining a student’s disability and the provision of specific accommodations: Student’s Self Report : The student is the most valuable resource for information regarding how the student may be impacted by their condition(s). The student’s experience of disability, barriers and effective accommodations is critical information. This information is gathered through the registration form and through meetings with Disability Resources & Accessibility staff. Observation and Interaction: In some cases, disability is apparent either in terms of presentation or effect. As part of the interactive process, Disability Resources & Accessibility staff may make appropriate and reasonable judgments that contribute toward the determination of disability. Documentation from External or Third Parties: Documentation from a qualified medical, psychological, or educational professional should provide information on the current impact/limitations of the condition in a postsecondary environment. 4. Accommodation Determination Students should contact the Disability Resources & Accessibility office and set-up an appointment to determine reasonable accommodations. The official registration and implementation of services cannot begin until the student meets with a Disability Resources & Accessibility staff member. Disability Resources & Accessibility professionals believe the student is the most valuable resource for determining effective and reasonable accommodations. Disability Resources & Accessibility assists students in becoming self-advocates while supporting their essential needs. Disability Resources & Accessibility assists faculty by providing information and by validating and providing necessary accommodations. Students who feel that they are experiencing problems/concerns in classes or the college setting should contact the office as soon as possible to resolve any difficulties they may be experiencing regarding accommodations or access on campus. Disability Resources & Accessibility will begin an interactive process with those individuals regarding the problems/concerns. Important Notes It is the student's responsibility to arrange for certain services that are outside the scope of Disability Resources & Accessibility and Maryville College. These services include, but may not be limited to, attendant care, mobility training, items/services of a personal nature, and sources of financial aid. Disability Resources & Accessibility professionals are available to consult with students regarding special needs and possible local resources. Letter of Accommodation When reasonable accommodations have been established, Disability Resources & Accessibility staff will create a Letter of Accommodation (LOA). The LOA indicates the academic accommodations which the student is qualified to receive. Students must grant permission each semester for the office to send the LOA to the student’s faculty. Students may choose which faculty the LOA is sent to. Students may ask for the letter to be sent to their advisor. Before issuing an LOA, Disability Resources & Accessibility must have a complete file. The file must include the registration form, appropriate documentation, and a signed Release of Information Waiver. Disability Resources & Accessibility staff will not discuss academic accommodation concerns with faculty members until all documents are received. Disability Resources & Accessibility will not disclose or discuss the disability documentation provided by the student without the written consent of the student. First Week of Class Responsibilities Students are encouraged to meet with each of their scheduled class professors during the first week of the term to discuss the LOA for the implementation of the accommodations. Students and faculty should contact Disability Resources & Accessibility with questions or concerns regarding ways to implement the qualifying accommodations. Continuing Enrollment Each semester, students should review their existing accommodations and request that their LOA be sent to their faculty. If additional accommodations are requested, Disability Resources & Accessibility will review current documentation and meet with the student to discuss the additional requested accommodations. Grievance Procedures An internal grievance procedure exists for students who Student Resources| 35 believe the accommodations provided were not reasonable or not being provided. Students should submit a written statement of the specific complaint within ten (10) business days of the alleged incident or action to the Director of Disability Resources & Accessibility. The Director will work to resolve such concerns informally through an interactive process with the student, pertinent faculty, or staff members. If the grievance is in relation to the Director of Disability Resources & Accessibility, then the grievance should be submitted to the Vice President & Dean of Students. To establish the basis for such a grievance, students should be registered with Disability Resources & Accessibility and receiving services. Students should expect to receive a written response to their grievance within ten (10) business days of submitting it. Appeal for Denial of Accommodations Any accommodation request that is denied will be reviewed by both the Assistant Director of Disability Resources and the Director of Disability Resources and Compliance. Students who have been denied a disability- related accommodation and would like to appeal the decision may file an appeal within ten (10) business days of the denial. Appeals should be submitted in writing by email to the Office of Disability Resources and Accessibility at disabilityresources@maryvillecollege.edu and copy the Dean of Students at mcdos@maryvillecollege.edu. Requests for appeal should include the date of denial, the denied accommodation(s), and a statement regarding why the accommodation should be granted. Students may only appeal a denial of accommodations; students may not appeal a request for additional documentation to support the accommodation request. Appeals will be determined by the Vice President and Dean of Students and are considered final. The appellate decision-maker will review the student’s request for appeal, original request for accommodation(s), and any supporting documentation and issue a decision in writing within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of the appeal. The decision will be emailed to the Maryville College email address of the student requesting the appeal and to the Office of Disability Resources and Accessibility. Misuse of Accommodations Accommodations should be used appropriately and in the manner which they are approved to address a student’s disability-related needs. Inappropriate use of accommodations may be subject to disciplinary action under the Academic Integrity Policy or the Student Code of Conduct depending on the nature of the violation. Misuse of accommodations includes, but is not limited to: • Using class recordings to harass other students, faculty, or staff • Using assistive technology to access the internet during exams • Distributing class recordings without permission • Being dishonest about an Emotional Support Animal’s access to a space Contacting Disability Resources & Accessibility Students can contact Disability Resources & Accessibility in the lower level of Thaw Hall, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m., via phone at 865.981.8120 or 865.981.8124, through the website www.maryvillecollege.edu/disability, or email disabilityresources@maryvillecollege.edu. Education Abroad Mark Twain once wrote, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness – all foes to real understanding.” Recognizing the validity of that statement, Maryville College believes a period of travel and study outside the United States should be a part of one’s education whenever possible. Confronting other cultures and viewpoints, learning about the customs and practices in other societies, coping with unfamiliar surroundings in a language not fully one’s own can do much to deepen insights and broaden perspectives. Such experience can also foster remarkable personal growth. Education abroad programs are offered through the Center for Global Engagement. Detailed information about education abroad is found at https://www.maryvillecollege.edu/studyabroad or by meeting with an Education Abroad Advisor at the Center for Global Engagement in International House. Every Maryville College student has the opportunity to travel abroad during their academic program. Travel Study Programs Short-term possibilities come through experiential travel with a small group of students and faculty. In recent years, groups of students and faculty have used three-week class terms and spring break for study travel to locales in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America. Students may apply for financial assistance. 36| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 Semester and Academic Year Education Abroad Programs For more extended periods, Maryville College has partnered with other foreign institutions. Through such associations Maryville students can experience life and study on a university or college campus in many areas of the globe. Maryville College maintains bilateral exchange partnerships and International Student Exchange Program (ISEP) exchange programs in 50 countries to over 150 overseas institutions. Program stipulations vary, but in most cases exchange programs are included in Maryville College fees - regular tuition and fees, and usually room and board are paid to Maryville College. Under these reciprocal agreements, when a Maryville student studies at a related institution, a student from that institution may study at Maryville for an equal time period. Through ISEP, students also have access to ISEP-Direct semester or summer programs. These are affordable fee- paid programs in a number of countries that do not offer the option to do an exchange. The majority of programs offer instruction in English; however, many programs also offer language study or full-immersion study in another language. Summer Abroad Summer Abroad programs (3-6 credits on average) give students the opportunity to study in a foreign country for a short period, often focusing on intensive language study or one field of study or one aspect of a country or culture. This is also a good option for students who are not able to study abroad during the regular academic year. Internships and Community Engagement Abroad Maryville College works with several international organizations to place students in internship abroad programs. These programs are generally between 6-10 weeks in length and are offered in locations around the world during the summer. Internships abroad are generally unpaid and are offered for academic credit. Students pay a program fee that covers placement, tuition, and housing costs. Planning, Eligibility and Application Process A period of study is possible at any time starting in spring break of the first year and the best time to study abroad during each student’s degree plan varies by major. Planning needs to start well in advance and is best done in close consultation with the academic advisor and the Center for Global Engagement. Approval for education abroad is required. Students apply to the Center for Global Engagement (CGE), must meet minimum G.P.A. standards, and must follow the application procedures set by the CGE. Students participating in semester, year abroad or summer study, internship or community engagement abroad programs are supported in the pre- departure phase by taking OVS 203 (p. 229): Cross Cultural Preparation for Education Abroad. Students also may choose to study at foreign institutions with which Maryville College does not have a relationship; however, different policies and practices may apply. Further, the College will scrutinize carefully, and may reject, credits earned at institutions overseas. The programs at institutions described in this catalog have been screened for academic quality and attention to the needs of students studying abroad. More information on programs can be found on the Maryville College education abroad website https://www.maryvillecollege.edu/studyabroad and through the Center for Global Engagement at International House. Education Abroad Scholarships and Aid Students on any Maryville College affiliated education abroad program are eligible to use FAFSA aid for periods abroad. Students are also eligible to use their merit aid for semester or year-long exchange programs, but not for ISEP-Direct, Direct Enroll, or non-affiliated programs. In addition to a student’s regular financial aid package, Maryville students studying abroad on an affiliated program may apply for additional scholarship support through the Ragsdale International Scholarship or the Tuck International Study Award. Deadlines for each award occur each semester for Maryville College sponsored programs scheduled for the following year. Student Resources| 37 Education Abroad Transfer Credit and Grades The Center for Global Engagement facilitates the pre- approval process for all education abroad programs and coursework. Credits earned through Maryville College approved semester and summer education abroad programs will appear on the Maryville College transcript as transfer credit, and grades earned will be calculated into the Maryville College GPA according to internationally recognized guidelines. Transfer credits earned through non-affiliated education abroad programs will appear on the Maryville College transcript, but grades will not calculate into the Maryville College GPA. If approved, Culture/Intercultural Domain credit in the Core curriculum may be earned for Maryville College approved programs of at least 6 weeks duration. Study abroad programs that are three or more weeks in duration may be used for a students’ significant practical experience (SPE) associated with the Maryville College Works program when pre- approved for this purpose. Maryville College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools’ Commission on Colleges to award Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. The College’s partner institutions are not accredited by the Commission on Colleges, and the accreditation of Maryville College does not extend to nor include the partner institutions or their students. Although Maryville College accepts certain coursework from the partner institutions as transfer credit towards its degrees, or collaborates in other ways for generation of course credits or program credentials, other colleges and universities may or may not accept this work in transfer; even if it appears on a transcript from the partner institutions. This decision is made by the institution subsequently considering acceptance of such credits. Fitness Center The Fitness Center is located in Alumni Gym. Facility use is free for all students, staff, and faculty. Examples of available exercise equipment include treadmills, elliptical machines, stationary bikes, TRX trainers, and free weights. In conjunction with the Fitness Center, several fitness classes are offered free of charge and are advertised campus wide. Health and Wellness TimelyCare TimelyCare provides access to medical and mental telehealth care, with no cost at the time of visit.

Responsible Student Computing All students should read and understand the Maryville College Network and Computer Use Policy as well as Copyright Information for Students. Instructional Technology Rapidly expanding technology has become a critical component of work in nearly every career path. Maryville College provides students with resources and opportunities to gain the proficiency and confidence necessary for them to thrive in a technology-dependent world. Technology is integrated in the teaching and learning experience and supports student creativity, productivity, efficiency, and scholarship as the College prepares students to succeed in academic pursuits and beyond. Nearly all courses are taught in technology-enabled Student Resources| 39 classrooms while outdoor laboratories and fieldwork incorporate various related technologies. A key component of the Maryville College technology learning experience is the Tartan, an online learning management system that facilitates student learning beyond the classroom and provides teaching and learning experiences wherever the opportunity exists. The Tartan allows students to interact with audio, video, and other material, as well as to submit completed work, and monitor individual course progress. Lamar Memorial Library Located in the Scots Learning Commons in Thaw Hall, the Lamar Memorial Library serves as a central resource for academic research and intellectual growth. The library collection supports the College’s curriculum, and librarians provide research assistance, citation help, interlibrary loan services, materials circulation, and archival research services to students, faculty, and staff. Librarians also teach information literacy and research skills, equipping students with the tools they need to excel academically. As an integral part of the Scots Learning Commons, the library fosters collaboration and learning in a welcoming and supportive environment. The Lamar Memorial Library prepares students for lives of citizenship and leadership by providing information access and teaching research and information literacy skills. The library provides information resources supporting the Maryville College curriculum, success in Maryville College degree programs, and individual scholarship and research. The library, as an academic division, teaches research skills and information literacy, empowering our community to discover, access, evaluate and use information effectively and ethically. Library programming strives to develop student information literacy as defined by the Association of College and Research Libraries as the “set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued, and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning.” (2016) Students successfully completing a program of study at Maryville College will have achieved the following learning outcomes: • Be able to determine the nature and extent of information needed, • Be able to access needed information effectively and efficiently, • Be able to evaluate information and its sources critically and incorporate selected information into their knowledge bases and values systems, • Be able to use information effectively, individually or as members of a group, to accomplish a specific purpose, • Be able to understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and • Be able to access and use information ethically and legally. Library Collections The Lamar Memorial Library provides physical and electronic information resources that are carefully selected to support the Maryville College curriculum and to support student and faculty research. When building collections, the librarians consider three interrelated components: a core collection of essential physical materials, a much more extensive and broader collection of electronic materials, and a robust set of information management tools connecting users with physical and electronic information resources. The primary access point for most of the Lamar Memorial Library’s information resources and collections is through the library website and the search portal, MC Quest. Research Assistance Librarians at the Lamar Memorial Library are committed to supporting students in their research endeavors through various accessible services. Students can receive in-person assistance or connect via chat, email, or Zoom, ensuring that help is always within reach. For more in-depth support, students are encouraged to schedule research appointments with librarians to explore library resources, refine their research topics, and develop effective strategies for finding and evaluating information. These personalized services empower students to approach their academic projects with confidence and success. Citation Help Librarians at the Lamar Memorial Library are dedicated to helping students with all aspects of their research, including creating accurate citations for their works cited pages. Students are encouraged to attempt their citations first, allowing librarians to review their work and provide suggestions for improvement. This collaborative approach helps students develop essential citation skills for their 40| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 academic success. Interlibrary Loan Through interlibrary loan services, the Lamar Memorial Library ensures that Maryville College students, faculty, and staff have access to a wealth of resources beyond our collection. If a needed source is not found in our collection, we can request it from another library. This invaluable service expands access to information and supports academic success by connecting our community with materials from a vast network of libraries. Circulation The Lamar Memorial Library offers convenient circulation services to provide access to a wide range of materials. Students, faculty, and staff can check out books and other resources at the Library Services Desk in the Scots Learning Commons. Librarians are available to assist with locating items, renewing materials, and answering questions about borrowing policies, ensuring that users can easily access the resources they need for their academic and personal interests. Archives The Maryville College Archives, located in Fayerweather Hall, is the official repository of the administrative and historical records of Maryville College. With archival material and artifacts dating back to the institution’s founding in 1819, the collections cover the breath of college life of a small liberal arts college. The Archives supports the educational goals of Maryville College through collecting, preserving, describing, and making available for research material related to the history and activities of Maryville College and is open to anyone for research whether they are affiliated with the College or a member of the general public. The Maryville College Archives is open for on-site research by appointment with the Maryville College Archivist. Virtual research assistance is also available via email, phone, and Zoom. Information about the Maryville College Archives is accessible via the Archives section of the library’s main web site. Scots Learning Commons The Scots Learning Commons (SLC) centralizes many programs and services supporting academic success in Thaw Hall. Services offered in the SLC include Academic Advising, Academic Success, Digital Edge, Disability Resources and Accessibility, and Lamar Memorial Library. Staff are available to assist students in Getting Personalized Support (GPS). The GPS Desk located in the Scots Learning Commons on the first floor of Thaw Hall is available to connect students with the resources and services in the SLC. The SLC provides amenities such as: - spaces for both group and individual study as well as basic office supplies housed at the GPS Desk - computer workstations as well as color and monochrome printing, scanning, and copying services for students - a variety of workspaces, including three classrooms with smart TV presentation systems, group study rooms, cozy study nooks, an active learning area with exercise equipment, and quiet study areas. TRIO Student Support Services The TRIO Student Support Services program, funded by the US Department of Education, is designed solely to help eligible students succeed and graduate from Maryville College. The program offers study sessions, academic planning, financial literacy workshops, one-on-one mentoring, and career counseling.

See the TRIO website for more information and to access the online application. Academic Procedures and Regulations| 41 Except where specifically noted, all academic policies and procedures apply to both undergraduate and graduate programs. Statement of Student Responsibility Each student is expected to be thoroughly familiar with the academic requirements of the College as stated in the Catalog. The responsibility for meeting all requirements for graduation rests entirely upon the student. Faculty advisors, academic division chairs, the Registrar, the Associate Dean, and the Vice President and Dean of the College welcome the opportunity to provide assistance, but the basic responsibility remains with the student personally. Academic Advising Every student has an academic advisor at all times. New first-year students work with the academic advising staff in the Advising Center in the summer before their first semester. Once classes start, the instructor in the First-Year Seminar (FYS 110) is the academic advisor for first-year students. When students declare a major, usually in February of the first year, advising shifts to a disciplinary faculty academic advisor who often remains the student’s advisor until graduation. Students who do not declare a major in February will be advised by staff in the Advising Center until a major is declared. New transfer students work with the academic advising staff in the Advising Center in the summer before their first semester. Transfer students who are ready to declare a major when the semester starts shift to a disciplinary faculty academic advisor who often remains the student's advisor until graduation. Frequent contact between academic advisor and student is essential. Academic advisors initiate some contacts, but students are strongly encouraged to make every effort to maintain a close relationship with their advisors. Because students hold full responsibility for ensuring that specific disciplinary requirements for graduation are completed, frequent and careful review of the College Catalog in consultation with advisors is helpful. Academic Integrity Academic Integrity Policy Truth and justice should be hallmarks of the academic community. Academic study involves a search for truth through critical evaluation of previous academic work. Effective teaching requires that the teacher be able to see the materials with which a student starts and, on the basis of the student’s results, judge the quality of the student’s effort and thought. Academic honesty is thus essential to effective learning. Any compromise of these moral cornerstones prevents an academic community and all of its members from being true seekers of wisdom. It is therefore very important for all members of the community to understand clearly the standards that define this collective search for wisdom. As the Maryville College Covenant declares, it is important for all students \"to act with integrity in all interaction...to encourage and support...fellow students as they aspire to be honest in their academic endeavors.\" Violations of Academic Integrity Breaches of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Cheating—this includes copying, or claiming as one’s own, the work of another student with or without his or her knowledge, and with or without subsequent revision; and the use of any unauthorized notes, crib sheets, or other written or electronic aids in exams or quizzes. Cheating includes ghost writing, submitting under the name of one author written work that was done by another author. 2. Plagiarism—inadequately acknowledging intellectual debts, either intentionally or unintentionally, in written work. This includes failure to document facts, ideas, wording, or organization taken from a source. It includes what some people call “mosaic plagiarism” which involves paraphrasing too closely to the original wording, that is, providing documentation of the source but either not using quotation marks to indicate borrowing of the author’s wording, or altering the source’s wording but not its sentence structure. It also includes failure to acknowledge informal debts for helpful suggestions— acknowledgement such as professional Academic Procedures and Regulations 42| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 scholars often make in a footnote or a prefatory statement (e.g., “I am gratefully indebted to Rita Johnson for suggesting this overall direction of inquiry”). The basic principle governing documentation is that anything— facts, ideas, wording, or organization—that is not common knowledge and is not original to the author should be documented. In doubtful cases, providing too much documentation is better than providing too little. 3. Unauthorized collaboration—any academic work on a specific assignment by more than one student without the prior approval of the instructor. Acceptable collaboration varies widely from professor to professor and from one assignment to another. Students must take responsibility to determine whether or not a collaborative effort is appropriate. 4. Fabrication—knowingly presenting false information in oral, written or artistic work, such as faked data in lab reports, falsified bibliographic citations, etc. It includes misrepresentation of academic records or credentials. 5. Unauthorized multiple submission—this includes simultaneous submission of the same piece of work in two courses without the prior approval of both instructors, as well as turning in any assignment for which one has already received credit, without the prior approval of the later instructor. The instructor receiving the later submission should have the opportunity to confer with the earlier instructor about the assignment and to determine whether the multiple submissions are appropriate. 6. Abuse of academic materials—destroying, losing, defacing or damaging intellectual resources that belong to someone else. Examples include defacing library materials; introducing viruses to college computers or erasing operational files from them; and abusing instructional tools, equipment, or materials. 7. Electronic dishonesty—this goes beyond plagiarism or fabrication from electronic sources. It includes inappropriate access to network files, accounts, or resources; knowingly spreading viruses; disabling computer hardware or software; software piracy; etc. 8. Unauthorized alteration or forgery of documents and records—this includes such things as forging an advisor’s signature or altering the information to which the signature is appended, altering an exam response and then requesting a review of the grade, or altering academic records. 9. Facilitation of academic dishonesty—knowingly helping someone else commit an act of academic dishonesty. This includes knowing of an instance of academic dishonesty and not disclosing it. 10. Failure to secure IRB and/or IACUC approval for human and animal research—research projects involving human participants and animal subjects are required by federal law to undergo review and approval by the Institutional Research Board (for human participants, including questionnaire surveys) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (for animal subjects). It is the responsibility of all members of the Maryville College community—students, faculty, staff, and administration—to familiarize themselves with the violations defined above. Students should understand that they have a special responsibility to the community to uphold the standard of conduct for themselves and for their classmates. This includes a responsibility to help ensure that breaches of academic integrity do not remain undiscovered. Faculty must accept the unique responsibility that they have for clearly defining, in course syllabi and assignments, the parameters of legitimate collaboration and any other areas in which the boundaries of academic integrity may be unclear. The administration has a responsibility to assist in the fair and timely implementation of standards and sanctions. Procedure for Individual Incidents If a teacher has information leading to a reasonable opinion that there has been an incident of academic dishonesty, the following procedures shall be followed: 1. The teacher should confer with his or her academic division chair (or some other trusted colleague if the teacher is also the division chair); 2. If both agree that the evidence establishes with certainty that academic integrity standards have been violated and if they agree on the extent of the offense, the teacher may proceed to assign without further process a grade penalty on the assignment, a penalty proportioned to the severity of the offense and not exceeding a grade of zero on the assignment. The teacher will place on file in the Registrar's Office a letter of censure recording the offense along with relevant documentation. Such a letter will not become part of the student's permanent academic record, but will be available during the student's time at the Academic Procedures and Regulations| 43 college to any faculty member who may later inquire whether the student has previously been found guilty of academic dishonesty. Before assigning a penalty, the teacher should check to see whether any prior letter of censure exists. If there is one letter of censure already on file, action is at the discretion of the faculty member who may either assign penalty or refer the case to the Academic Integrity Board (AIB). If two letters are already on file, the teacher must refer the case to the AIB. At such time, the Registrar will initiate the preliminary procedures specified below. The teacher must discuss with the student the offense and the penalty, informing the student of his or her right to appeal the decision and the penalty to the AIB. If the student does appeal to the AIB, the student should notify the Registrar's Office of the appeal, and the Registrar's Office should withhold the letter of censure from the file pending the outcome of the appeal; 3. If the teacher and the academic division chair (or other trusted colleague) finds that either the severity of the offense calls for a penalty greater than a zero on the assignment, or the evidence fails to establish with certainty the suspected student's guilt or the extent of the offense, then the teacher must confer with the student, who will be confronted with the charge. If the student admits guilt, the teacher will place a letter of censure with relevant documentation on file in the Registrar’s Office and may assign without further process one or more penalties from among the following: a. a grade penalty on the assignment b. zero on the assignment c. a failing grade in the course. The teacher should inform the student of his or her right to appeal the sanction to the Academic Integrity Board. If the student does not admit guilt, the teacher may drop the matter or may refer the case to the AIB. Any case in which the teacher seeks a penalty beyond a letter of censure and a failing grade in the course (e.g., community service, suspension, or expulsion) should be referred to the AIB; 4. In a case of plagiarism or faulty documentation involving a student who has not yet taken Composition and Speech II (ENG 120) with its discussions of plagiarism and documentation, the teacher may, upon adequate establishment of the student's guilt as outlined above, opt to provide the student an opportunity to correct or to redo the assignment either with or without penalty for the sake of the student's learning the requirements of correct documentation. This leniency of procedure applies only to students who have not been informed of the requirements of academic integrity as taught in ENG 120; 5. If the academic division chair (or colleague) does not believe that the evidence warrants pursuit of the case, the teacher is still free to discuss the matter with the student and to refer the case to the Academic Integrity Board, but the teacher must not peremptorily assign a penalty; and 6. Any member of the College community wishing to refer a case to the Academic Integrity Board must notify the Registrar, who will notify the other parties involved, request from them for safekeeping any physical evidence connected with the case, and notify the AIB chair. Academic Integrity Board Purpose and Jurisdiction The Academic Integrity Board (AIB) investigates and adjudicates cases of alleged academic dishonesty involving college courses or library use. Membership The Board will be composed of three faculty members and two students, and is to be constituted early in the fall term each year. The Vice President and Dean of the College will call an organizational meeting. The faculty members will be those who have completed a term on the Academic Life Council (ALC) in the previous two years. If there are four such persons, three will be selected by lot and the fourth will serve as an alternate who will replace a faculty member who is unable to serve on a particular case. If an additional alternate is needed, priority will be given to the current ALC member representing the same constituency as the person to be replaced. If that person cannot serve, or is otherwise disqualified, another faculty member of ALC will be selected by lot. The student members will be the two students with the longest service on ALC. The third student will serve as alternate. The Board’s tenure shall be from the beginning of the academic year up to the beginning of the next academic year. Cases held over from the previous academic year become the responsibility of the newly constituted Board. 44| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 For hearings, a quorum will consist of three faculty and two student members. Officers Chair: When the Board is convened in the fall, one of the faculty members will be chosen as chair. Investigator/presenter: The Board will appoint one of its members as an investigator/presenter (non-voting) for each case. An appropriate alternate member of the AIB, either student or faculty, will substitute for the presenter in hearing the case. Secretary: The Board will appoint a secretary who will prepare a written record of the proceedings in each case, and prepare written notices of charges, hearings, verdicts, sanctions, appeals, etc. The secretary may not simultaneously serve as investigator/presenter in any case. Preliminary Procedures If alleged academic dishonesty is referred by a teacher to the Academic Integrity Board, the teacher shall notify the Registrar, who will notify the accused student, request from both parties for safekeeping any physical evidence connected with the case, and notify the AIB chair. If academic dishonesty is detected by someone other than the teacher, the following procedures will be followed: 1. The person will notify the Registrar and pass on all physical evidence for safekeeping. 2. The Registrar will notify the chair and the teacher involved. 3. The chair will meet with the person reporting the alleged academic dishonesty to obtain information about the charge. On receiving notification of the case from the Registrar and following conference with the teacher or person reporting the case, the chair will take the following actions: 1. Appoint one member of the AIB to serve as investigator/presenter (non-voting) for the case 2. Schedule a hearing and inform the accused and the accuser of the charge and the time and place of the hearing 3. Schedule the hearing as soon as possible after the offense is detected, unless mitigating circumstances (e.g., education abroad) require a delay. In no case should an initial hearing take place more than one year after the offense is detected 4. Notify appropriate parties at least 24 hours prior to the hearing. Conduct of the Board Every member of the Board has the right and responsibility to speak and vote freely. It is the responsibility of each voting member to vote “aye” or \"nay” on a motion of verdict or sanction. It is the responsibility of all parties involved in the proceedings to maintain confidentiality of the proceedings. A member of the Board shall disqualify himself or herself in a particular case if he or she is unable to maintain impartiality. Any member who so disqualifies himself or herself shall not be present in any capacity other than that of witness, accuser, accused, or advisor to the accused. No member will disclose to anyone other than members of the Board the degree of harmony or unanimity of the Board or the opinions or votes of any members of the Board. The record of Board meetings will be available only to: 1. The accused and his or her advisor 2. Members of the Academic Integrity Board 3. Vice President and Dean of the College 4. President of the College 5. Vice President and Dean of Students The secretary will report in writing the results of a hearing to the campus newspaper editor, including only: 1. Charge (excluding the name of the accused) 2. Nature of the evidence 3. Sentence 4. Rationale for the sentence Rights of the Accused Student 1. Notice of charges will be received by the accused as soon as possible after the offense is detected 2. The student may be assisted by any advisor of his or her choice from the College community. At the hearing said advisor acts only as a consultant and may not address the hearing Academic Procedures and Regulations| 45 3. The student may decline to testify and may have witnesses in his or her behalf at the hearing 4. The student may challenge for bias any member of the AIB. The AIB (excluding the challenged member) will rule on any challenge 5. The student may request an open hearing from the AIB chair no less than 24 hours in advance 6. During the appeal period, the student may read the record of the hearing. Hearing Procedures Only AIB members, the accuser, the accused, and the advisor to the accused will be present at the hearings, unless an open hearing has been scheduled. Any student referred to the Board must appear at the time set for the hearing. If a student fails to appear without justifiable reason, the case will be heard in absentia. The AIB chair may recess the hearing at any time for any reasonable purpose. The Order of Hearing will be as follows: 1. The chair will introduce the accused student and the AIB members 2. AIB members may be challenged by the student for bias. Any challenge is deliberated by the AIB in private, and either sustained or denied. If the challenge is sustained, the hearing will be reconvened when an alternate AIB member is available 3. The presenter states the charge 4. The accused enters a plea 5. Evidence in support of the charge is presented in the presence of the accused 6. Witnesses in support of the charge testify in the presence of the accused and answer questions by the accused 7. The accused presents a statement in the presence of the accuser 8. Evidence in support of the accused is presented in the presence of the accuser; 9. Witnesses in support of the accused testify in the presence of the accuser and answer questions by the accuser 10. The accused, the accuser, or Board members may seek clarification of evidence or reexamine any witness 11. Board members will deliberate. The Board shall utilize the concept of precedent; however, the specific circumstances of the case shall also bear on the outcome. The Board determines a verdict (guilty, not guilty, or insufficient evidence) and any sanction(s) to be imposed 12. The chair informs the accused of the verdict and sanctions. If the student is deemed guilty, the chair advises the accused of the right to appeal. Written notice of verdicts and sanctions are prepared by the Secretary 13. Sanctions are reported to the Vice President and Dean of the College. Sanctions A student found guilty of academic dishonesty shall receive a sanction or sanctions deemed appropriate to the offense. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, a formal letter of censure, a requirement to perform community service on or off the campus, a grade of “F” on the assignment in question, dismissal from the course with a grade of “F,” suspension, or expulsion from the College. The AIB will be guided by precedent in determining sanctions. When a verdict of guilty is reached, a record of the offense, the sanctions, and the proceedings shall be kept permanently in the Registrar’s office in a file that must remain separate from the Permanent Academic Record. Appeals The Vice President and Dean of the College shall have the responsibility to hear appeals of decisions of the Academic Integrity Board. Appeals must be made in writing to the Office of the Vice President and Dean of the College not more than 10 days after the conclusion of the hearing. Bases for appeal include the following: 1.

New evidence 46| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 Auditing a Course A full-time student is permitted to audit one course each semester without additional charge. Adding a course as an audit or changing enrollment from credit to audit must take place within the first week of the semester and permission of the instructor is necessary. The audit does not count toward graduation requirements, but does appear on the permanent academic record if attendance is satisfactory. Students should note that credit by examination cannot be earned for courses that have been taken as an audit at Maryville College. Catalog-Year-Determination A Catalog Year is the academic year (usually Fall to Summer) when a student first enrolls full-time as a degree- seeking student at the College. The Catalog Year dictates which specific degree requirements a student needs to complete their degree. A student is normally expected to satisfy the graduation requirements published in the Catalog in the academic year of their initial matriculation, provided there are no breaks in continuous enrollment. During their time as degree-seeking students at Maryville College, students may elect to adopt a more recent Catalog, subject to the following restrictions: 1. Students must use a single Catalog for all graduation requirements. Mixing Catalogs is not allowed. 2. Students may not choose a Catalog Year prior to their matriculation. 3. Students must notify the Registrar's Office before the start of the semester if they want to change their Catalog Year. Procedures for changing the Catalog Year can be found on the Registrar's website. 4. Students who add or change a major(s), minor(s), or certificate(s) will retain the original Catalog Year unless they notify the Registrar's Office that they plan to change to a newer Catalog Year. 5. When the College updates graduation requirements, students may choose to adopt a newer Catalog Year, but are not required to do so if the changes would delay graduation. Academic departments will ensure that a reasonable path to graduation remains available under the student's original Catalog Year. 6. If students change their Catalog Year, they may not move back to an older Catalog Year. A student's Catalog Year remains active as long as there is no interruption in Enrollment. Otherwise, a Catalog is active for 6 years. Students seeking readmission to the College should consult the Catalog Year language on the Readmission page (p. 13). Class Attendance Regular attendance at classes is expected of all students, though each instructor is free to set whatever attendance requirements for an individual course are deemed suitable. These requirements are printed in the course syllabus. Students should pay close attention to the attendance policy for each of their classes. Refer to Administrative Withdrawal section in this catalog. The College recognizes as legitimate reasons for occasional absence such difficulties as illness, accident, family grief, or pressing personal responsibility. If absences for these or other reasons are excessive in terms of the stated attendance policy for the class, the student should explain the problem to the instructor, or the instructor may initiate such a discussion. If excessive absences persist, the student may be assigned a grade of “F” for the course. Occasionally students who represent the College in off- campus activities find it necessary to miss classes. The number of such absences, however, may not exceed 10% of the class meetings without the permission of the instructor. Students should notify the professor in advance to reschedule course work where necessary. Class Schedule During the regular semester, most classes are scheduled Monday through Friday in Monday- Wednesday-Friday and Tuesday-Thursday formats. Evening courses normally meet one or two evenings each week. Some courses, many of them four credit hour courses, meet more often and may include laboratory periods. May term classes usually meet for three hours Monday through Friday during the three- week session. Summer classes meet on a varied schedule during the three-week session, a five-week session, or the full 11-week session. Conferral of Degrees Commencement exercises are held annually at the close of the spring semester. Degrees are conferred at the May commencement only for students who have completed all graduation requirements. Students who have not completed all degree requirements Academic Procedures and Regulations| 47 by the end of the spring semester will be scheduled to participate in the commencement ceremony the following academic year. However, students can petition to participate in the current year’s commencement if they meet all of the following conditions: 1. They have fewer than 12 credit hours remaining to complete their degree. 2. They submit a Degree Completion Plan, approved by their academic advisor, outlining how and when the remaining requirements will be fulfilled. 3. The approved plan is submitted to the Registrar’s Office at least three weeks prior to the commencement ceremony. Degrees will be officially conferred upon completion of all requirements in May, August, or December. Students may participate in commencement exercises only once, during the academic year in which they complete their degree requirements or are approved to participate early under this policy. Course Load To complete a degree in four years, students must earn an average of 30 credits each year. Programs of study requiring more than the minimum 120 hours require higher semester course loads to complete the degree within four years. No more than four credit hours may be taken in any one of the three-week periods. A course load of 12 hours is required for full-time status and the maximum load is 18 hours in a semester. Within the semester, overload charges will be assessed for each credit hour over 18 (See the section Admissions and Financial Aid (p. 10) in this Catalog). Credit by Examination Recognizing that college-level learning occurs in places other than the college classroom, Maryville College accepts credits earned through several testing programs that include proficiency exams offered by Maryville College faculty, the Advanced Placement program, the International Baccalaureate program, Excelsior College Examinations, the College Level examination Program (CLEP), and the DSST (Dantes) Examination Program. Students may prepare for credit by examination in a variety of ways but may not use the course audit option for this purpose, as credit by examination is not available for courses audited at Maryville College. Advanced Placement Program (AP) AP exams are offered in a variety of subjects. In order to receive college credit, students must score a four or a five on the AP examination. Course credit provided for each test score of a four or five is listed below. Questions about credit should be referred to the College Registrar. 48| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 AP Exam Name Score of 4 or 5 recorded as: Fine Arts: Art History ART 111 (3 credit hrs.)

Students who wish to continue on in computer science related fields should contact the computer science program coordinator to discuss options. International Baccalaureate (IB) IB credit may be earned in a variety of subjects. In order to receive college credit for IB courses completed in high school, students must score a four on the IB examination. Questions about credit should be referred to the College Registrar. Excelsior College Examinations (ECE) Excelsior College Examinations are offered in many disciplines. College credit is available when a score equivalent to a grade of C is attained. Most ECE exams are 3-hour tests administered via computer at Pearson VUE Testing Centers. Excelsior College, formerly called Regents College, replaced the ACT-PEP (American College Testing Proficiency Examination Program) exams. College Level Examination Program The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) offers examinations in the areas listed below. If a student’s score is equal to the CLEP mean scaled score for a grade of “C,” credit may be granted. Except as noted below, three credit hours are granted for all examinations, regardless of the recommendations in CLEP publications.

DSST (Formerly DANTES Subject Standardized Test) Maryville College accepts credit from the DSST credit by examination program. Credit allotments and minimum acceptable scores are set according to the guidelines of the American Council on Education. Credit Hours Amount of Credit Credit hours are determined by the amount of interaction between students and the course/credit bearing activity and are based on a normal 15-week semester. Expected student academic activity is extrapolated from full semester expectations for academic pursuits that take place in May, summer, and other compressed terms. For purposes of the application of this policy and in accord with federal regulations, a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates: 1. Not less than one hour (50 minutes + 10-minute break) of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours (100 minutes + 20 minutes break) out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time, or 2. At least an equivalent amount of work as required outlined in item 1 above for other academic activities including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours and based on the following considerations: Regular classroom courses - One credit hour for each 50- minute class session throughout the semester – most commonly, three-credit hour courses meet 150 minutes each week throughout the semester. Laboratory courses - One additional credit hour for each course related, weekly laboratory session throughout the semester. Private music lessons - One credit hour for each 30-minute private music lesson and 3 hours practice time weekly throughout the semester - additional credit hours are associated with appropriate incremental lesson and practice expectations. Fine arts ensembles/theatre production - One credit hour for participation in music ensemble or theatre production throughout the semester (may vary according to ensemble expectations). Internships - One credit hour for every 3 hours spent in internship site weekly throughout the semester. Physical activity courses - One credit hour for two 50- minute sessions weekly throughout the semester. Individualized study - One meeting weekly throughout the semester with faculty supervisor. The extent of related individualized assignments is based on credit hours enrolled. Senior study - One meeting weekly with faculty supervisor throughout the semester with required individualized student research activity related to topic. Honors - An additional credit hour option added to regular course based on significant and advanced work beyond the normal scope of the course – Permission required. Maryville College Life Enrichment Program (Portfolio) - One credit hour for completion of each approved activity – Restrictions apply (See this Catalog for a full description of this program). Online and Hybrid Courses - Whereas a traditional face-to- face class has 750 classroom minutes and 1,500 minutes of expected out-of-class academic engagement per credit hour for a total of 2,250 minutes of academic engagement, an online course also has 2,250 minutes of expected academic engagement per credit hour. Online and hybrid courses corresponding to courses offered in a traditional, face-to-face format must meet the same content requirements and student learning outcomes Academic Procedures and Regulations| 51 as courses offered in the traditional format. For these courses, academic credit is equivalent to the amount of academic credit awarded for the corresponding face-to-face courses. For online or hybrid courses with no corresponding face-to-face courses, course expectations and student learning outcomes are based on national expectations and accrediting standards for the degree. Academic credit is awarded based on student attainment of these course expectations and learning outcomes. In hybrid courses, the classroom minutes are reduced by either 33% or 50%, and the online/out-of-class academic engagement is increased by the same percentage, as noted in the examples below. Students achieve the same learning outcomes regardless of delivery method. More information about Course Delivery Modes is on the College website, in the Registrar section of Academics.

Courses numbered 101-199 are primarily for first year students, 201-299 for sophomores, and 300-399 for juniors and seniors. A few courses numbered 401 and higher are intended primarily for seniors. Courses numbered at the 500-699 are for graduate level courses. MTH 105 Fundamentals of Mathematics is a remedial math course that does not carry academic credit toward the minimum hours needed for graduation, is not used in the calculation of grade point average, but the hours will count in the calculation of full-time/part-time status. Dean’s List The Dean’s List is composed of those students whose academic performance was distinguished in the previous semester. To qualify, a grade point average of at least 3.60 in all work undertaken must be earned, with no grade below “C.” Only full-time students are considered. A notation appears on the transcript each semester the Dean’s List is achieved. Dropping a Course See procedures for Dropping a Course (p. 62) in the Withdrawal section of the Catalog. Examination Policy Grading and assessment procedures for individual courses are stated in the course syllabus. Individual faculty members are free to decide what means are appropriate for assessing student achievement during a semester that may include: quizzes scheduled whenever useful, term papers, written and oral reports, discussion assignments, course projects, examinations, etc. Instructors may also weigh these measuring devices in any fashion that is fair and clearly communicated to students in the course syllabus. The last week of each semester is the final examination period. During this period, the usual daily schedule is not followed; instead, each course meets at one of three exam times on the day designated by the Registrar: 9:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., or 3:30 p.m. If a final examination is given, it must be held at the assigned time. How much of that two- hour block of time is used and the method of the end-of- term evaluation is left to the discretion of individual instructors, but students should be informed on these matters well in advance (preferably in the course syllabus). Students who have three final examinations scheduled on the same day may request and arrangements may be made with one of the instructors for one examination to be 52| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 rescheduled. Arrangements are made with the course instructors with the assistance of the Associate Dean if necessary. The schedule for the examination period is prepared with an eye to avoiding conflicts for students. Since using any time other than that designated for a particular class is likely to create such conflicts, close adherence to the schedule is expected. Grade Disagreements In the event a student and a professor disagree about the quality of the student’s academic work and the final course grade, the disagreement should be resolved in discussion between the parties involved. If this discussion does not resolve the matter, the student may appeal to the Academic Division Chair. If no agreement is reached as a result of this effort, either of the disputers may request the Associate Dean to act as mediator. The mediator may aid decision making, but may not arbitrate. As a last step, a request may be filed with the Associate Academic Dean for the formation of a committee composed of the Associate Dean, two other faculty members, and two students acceptable to both parties involved in the grade dispute. This committee will initially mediate with the authority to arbitrate. The majority decision of the committee is final. Grades are not open for dispute more than one year after the end of the term in which the grade is assigned. Grade Point Average (GPA) The grade point average (GPA) for a semester is computed by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the number of credit hours for which quality points are earned during the semester. The cumulative GPA is based on all quality points earned and all credit hours for which quality points are earned at Maryville College. A course may be repeated once to replace a previous grade. A second course repeat may replace a grade only with permission of the Dean or Associate Dean of the College. Course grades earned in repeated attempts beyond these limits may not replace previously earned grades and the grade earned in each repeat is included in the GPA calculation. Courses completed satisfactorily at other institutions may count toward graduation requirements, but they are not counted in computing the GPA. The three-credit entry for Fundamentals of Mathematics 105 does not count in the minimum needed for graduation and is not included in the graduation GPA. This course is treated as a three-credit hour equivalent only in the determination of full- or part-time status. Grade Notification Grades are available to students at the end of each term via Self Service. Grades are normally posted by noon on the Wednesday following the examination week at which time they become part of the student’s permanent academic record on file in the Registrar’s office. In accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, grades are not sent to parents or guardians unless (1) the student submits a written request that this be done, or (2) the parent or guardian makes a request by providing documentation certifying that the student is dependent as defined by the Internal Revenue Service. Such requests must be written and filed with the Registrar. Grading and Academic Standards Faculty members determine grading standards for all grades within individual courses. This information can be found on the course syllabus. The grading system at Maryville is as follows: A – Excellent B – Good C – Satisfactory D – Passing F – Failed Quality points for calculation of the grade point average (GPA) are assigned as follows: Academic Procedures and Regulations| 53 Grade # of Quality Points A+ 4.00 A 4.00 A- 3.70 B+ 3.30 B 3.00 B- 2.70 C+ 2.30 C 2.00 C- 1.70 D+ 1.30 D 1.00 D- 0.70 F 0.00 Students are graded under this system in all required general education courses, most electives, and unless stated otherwise, all courses taken to meet major requirements. In some situations, grades of “S” (Satisfactory) and “U” (Unsatisfactory) are used. The “S” grade is understood to be the equivalent of at least a “C.” Most experiential education courses, Maryville College Life Enrichment Program projects, education senior studies (EDU 351), and most internships are graded on this basis. At the student’s option, one elective course each year may be graded “S” or “U.” Students must notify the course instructor and Registrar in writing within the first week of class meetings if they elect to take a course for an \"S\" or \"U.\" In the following exceptional circumstances these grades are given: I. Incomplete - Given as a temporary grade when a course cannot be completed due to reasons beyond the student’s control; becomes an “F” unless the work is carried to completion by the end of the next semester. W Withdrew - Given when a course is dropped during the first 45 days of classes. This grade does not affect grade point average. Graduation Honors To qualify for graduation with honors, a student must have completed at least 60 hours at Maryville College. The cumulative grade point average determines the level of honors. The three levels of honors and the minimum grade point averages required are: Summa cum laude: 3.95 Magna cum laude: 3.75 Cum laude: 3.50 Graduation honors are based on grades earned at the time of graduation and are not recalculated as a result of any coursework completed after graduation. Late Enrollment Students are expected to attend the first class meeting of each course. After the first meeting, enrollment in the course is possible with the permission of the advisor. Students and advisors should communicate with the course instructor to ensure that a late enrollment is feasible considering what may have already been covered in the class. After the first week of classes, enrollment is possible only with the permission of the advisor, the instructor, and the Associate Dean. Permission to enter a course after five class meetings is given only in rare circumstances. Leave of Absence LEAVE OF ABSENCE REGISTRATION AND REINSTATEMENT Students who wish to leave the College temporarily (excluding summers) for academic, medical, religious, or military service-related reasons may request a Leave of Absence for a specific period of time. Leave of absence is meant for students who plan to complete a Maryville College degree but who have a need to be away from their Maryville College studies for an extended period. Leave of Absence is distinct from both withdrawal from the College and suspension from it. Typically, it is arranged in advance of the semester for which it is granted. It is usually not granted for a semester once that semester is underway, although it may be granted for the following semester. Some situations (e.g., those created by military deployment or health-related reasons) may call for leaves granted during a relevant semester. 54| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 Leaves are usually approved for one semester and may be extended to one year with approval of the Committee on Academic Standing. An exception to this general rule is made for leaves granted so that students may complete the second part of a dual degree program at other partner institutions, in which case the standard leave time is two years. In most cases, a Leave of Absence may not exceed a cumulative total of two years. Leave of Absence may not end during a semester that is in progress. Applications for Leave of Absence must be submitted to the Registrar. Leaves of Absence must be requested at least three weeks before the beginning of the term during which the student wants to be absent from the College. Requests for unexpected leaves must be made as soon as possible and are not considered or approved retroactively. Students who do not return after the specific term of the Leave of Absence will be withdrawn retroactive to their leave date and may face financial consequences. Leaves of more than 180 days may also have financial consequences. Students in multiple majors may not request a leave of absence status from only one program. International students should also contact the Center for Global Engagement to discuss eligibility and potential visa issues. As noted above, the College recognizes four kinds of leave of absence: academic, medical, religious, and military: A. Application for a leave of absence for academic reasons is granted only for the purpose of academic enrichment. Typically, this will be for completion of the non-Maryville College portion of a dual degree program (for example, a 3-2 Engineering program). The student’s academic advisor must certify that the student has completed all Maryville College-specific requirements of the dual degree program and is ready to move on to the second part of the dual degree program. In the case of academically motivated leaves taken for reasons other than the completion of a dual degree program, students taking courses elsewhere while on Leave of Absence must obtain division approval in advance for any course to be used as transfer credit for degree completion. Students and advisors should bear in mind that there are rules governing the minimum number of hours which must be completed at the College for a Maryville College degree, and certain requirements which must be satisfied on campus. Study abroad under the auspices of Maryville College is managed through Overseas Study registration and is not addressed by this policy. A student taking Leave of Absence registration in order to complete a dual degree program has the option to participate in Commencement, ordinarily at the point at which the student completes the minimum number of hours for a Maryville College degree. The actual degree will not be awarded until the official transcript has been received from the partner institution and the required transfer credit has been awarded. Students taking academic Leave of Absence from the College in order to complete the non-Maryville College portion of a dual degree program may choose to live in College residence halls, depending on the availability of space, in accordance with Maryville College rules and the College’s schedule. Accordingly, they would also participate in a College meal plan. Normal room and board fees will apply, and the needs of enrolled students will take precedence in the allotment of rooms. Students taking academic Leave of Absence for dual degree programs may also continue to use other facilities and services normally available to registered students, such as health services, the post office, email and printing accounts, sports passes, etc., to participate in College-sponsored events open to all College students, and (where consistent with the requirements of dual degree partners) participate in College-sponsored student activities such as ensembles and team sports. The College will decide upon suitable student fees to support these activities on a yearly basis. The use of College rooms, facilities, and/or services and participation in College-sponsored student activities are not allowed to students on Leave of Absence for any reason other than the completion of dual degree programs. B. Application for a medical-related Leave of Absence must be accompanied by medical documentation in support of the leave and in support of readiness to return, as feasible under the circumstances. Medical Leave of Absence differs from medical withdrawal, in that medical Leave of Absence is better suited to students who are proactively seeking to address their health issues by taking an entire semester off, or in any case who have some sense of when they expect to be back. Medical withdrawal is better suited to students who encounter unexpected health problems that make it impossible for them to continue their studies or impossible to finish a semester. C. Application for Leave of Absence for religious reasons is suitable for religious obligations that are of an extended character and that would make it impossible for a student to succeed during a semester. It is not given for recurring observances that take less than a semester to fulfill (such as, for example, Lent, Easter, Ramadan, or Eid) but for longer term obligations, such as pilgrimage or extended mission trips. Academic Procedures and Regulations| 55 D. Application for a Leave of Absence due to a military call to active duty is granted when accompanied by a copy of relevant military orders, at the time a student is required to stop attending classes. E. Other types of leaves may be considered on a case- by-case basis. Students returning from an approved Leave of Absence are not required to apply for readmission but instead need only submit a “return to campus” notification to the Registrar’s Office by April 1 for a Fall Semester return or November 1 for the following Spring Semester. Reinstatement is never guaranteed or automatic. The College reserves the right to require additional documentation that the student is qualified and ready to return. Decisions regarding financial aid are made separately from the reinstatement process. See Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence (ETLOA) (p. 55) for policy and procedures for granting a brief absence during the semester. Leave of Absence - Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence A student may be granted an Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence (ETLOA) for a period not to exceed two consecutive weeks at one time, within an academic semester. Each request will be reviewed on an individualized basis and may require appropriate documentation to support the request. Additional time may be granted, when medically indicated. Requests for an emergency temporary leave of absence will be reviewed and approved by the Vice President & Dean of Students and communicated to the Assistant Academic Dean for a specified period of time. An emergency temporary leave of absence may be applicable for students who must be absent for mental and/or physical health reasons, or any other personal or family emergency. Failure to attend classes by the return date specified on the emergency temporary leave of absence form may result in an administrative withdrawal from the College. Students are encouraged to consult with appropriate offices regarding the applicability of an emergency temporary leave of absence. Examples of such consultations may include, but are not limited to, conversations with the Student Outreach & Support Specialist, Title IX Coordinator, Disability Resources & Accessibility staff, Director of Prevention Education, Counseling Center staff, and/or academic advisor. Students may submit their request via email, by contacting the Dean of Students office (mcdos@maryvillecollege.edu) during College business hours. When feasible, students should seek approval of the emergency temporary leave of absence prior to the start of the absence. However, the College is aware that extenuating circumstances may exist in emergency situations where such prior approval is not feasible. Major and Minor Declaration Deadlines All matriculated students must declare a major before completing 60 credits towards graduation. Transfer students entering with 60 credits or more must declare their major by the 10th day of classes in their first semester. The following procedures apply for students who are listed as undeclared, have earned 48 credits towards graduation, and are enrolled for a subsequent term. • A student who has earned 48 credits towards graduation and is enrolled for additional credits will be notified by email from the Registrar’s Office of the requirement to declare a major before registering for more than 60 credits. The student will also be informed that a registration hold will be placed on their account if they fail to comply. • If a major has not been declared by the time a student attempts to register for beyond 60 credits, a registration hold will prevent registration beyond 60 credits. • A student must submit the Major/Minor Declaration form to the Office of the Registrar with the signature of the appropriate Division Chair for the major being declared. Once processed, the hold flag will be removed from student’s account and the student will be eligible for registration. Requests to change the major and/or minor will be accepted by the Registrar’s Office at any time, but requests submitted after the drop/add period closes for the current semester will not be effective until the beginning of the next semester. The deadline to make a final change of major prior to graduation is March 1 for May commencement of the 56| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 following year, April 1 for Summer term graduation of the following year, and October 1 for December graduation of the following year. The final deadline to declare a minor is the 3rd week of the penultimate semester before graduation. After these dates, applications may be approved on a case by case basis by the Assistant Dean for Academic Success and may require mandatory financial aid counseling. Applications are available from the Registrar’s page on the Tartan. Students missing the deadline may appeal to the Registrar. May Term The annual three-week May Term offers students an attractive option for travel-study courses (in the U.S. and abroad) or a valuable opportunity to take a course on campus. Students interested in travel-study courses are referred to the study–abroad section of this catalog. Non-Traditional Modes of Learning No more than 32 credit hours may be counted toward graduation requirements for any combination of credit by examination, internships, military coursework, or online courses. Credit for courses offered through non-traditional modes of learning will be granted only for courses offered by accredited institutions and, before credit is granted, each course will be evaluated to ensure it meets requirements of Maryville College course work. Probation and Suspension It is the responsibility of individual students to maintain good academic standing and to make normal progress toward a degree. The record of each student is regularly reviewed by the Registrar. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.00 are placed on academic probation. To continue enrollment in probationary status, students must show steady improvement in academic performance. Full-time, first-year-in-college students who are placed on academic probation following the first fall semester must successfully complete a Maryville College Life Enrichment Program Portfolio Project in self-management through the Academic Support Center during the first spring semester. Students who fail to complete the project successfully are subject to suspension from the College. At the end of each term careful consideration is given to the record of each student. Students who fall below minimum standards for credit hours and cumulative grade point average are not considered to be making normal progress toward a degree and are subject to suspension from the College or to a change from degree candidacy to special student status. These minimum standards are listed below. Following a suspension, students may apply for readmission after at least a semester of satisfactory academic work at another institution or successful work experience. Students placed in special student status by action of the College may continue enrollment and, when the cumulative GPA is raised to at least 2.00, petition for readmission to degree candidacy. A decision to suspend may be appealed to the College’s Committee on Academic Standing. In such an appeal, the obligation rests with the student to explain the special considerations that support continued enrollment. GPA Requirements to Avoid Suspension Credit Hours Attempted Minimum GPA 0 – 30 1.00 31 – 60 1.60 61 – 90 1.92 91 and above 2.00 Proficiency Exams Proficiency exams are permitted in lieu of Maryville College coursework in special circumstances. There is an examination fee of $75, and permission of the academic division chair is required. Maryville College faculty prepare examinations covering the content of a specific catalog course. Proficiency exams are not given for experiential learning courses, internships, physical education activities courses, studio art, applied music, or the Life Enrichment Program. Progress Reports – Three Week and Mid-Semester Progress reports are completed twice each semester. During the third week of the semester, the Academic Support Center staff requests faculty of all 100-level courses to submit a progress report for any student who is having academic difficulty. At mid-semester, faculty submit a progress grade for all students to the Registrar. Academic Procedures and Regulations| 57 All three-week progress reports and mid - semester progress grades are shared with students’ faculty advisor and other appropriate College staff. These reports are used to inform and counsel students and are not recorded on the official transcript. Students are expected to stay current in each course and to contact their professor if they have questions about their progress. Furthermore, students should not view a mid-semester progress grade as an implied final grade. Although early course success is often associated with a positive final grade, students should keep in mind that the majority of course assignments are typically completed and graded after the mid-semester reporting period. Specialized and Individualized Programs of Instruction Maryville College offers many opportunities for students to tailor their learning experiences to their own needs and interests. The regulations governing these opportunities are set out below. Honors Study Honors study at Maryville College may be pursued in three ways. Participation in any honors program is reserved for those students with a cumulative grade point average of 3.25 or higher and who have attained sophomore standing. However, first year Presidential and Dean’s scholars enroll in Honors Tutorial Training. Honors work is voluntary, except for Presidential Scholars and Dean’s Scholars, who are required to participate in a prescribed number of honors activities. Honors study is distinct from and in no way related to honors designations for graduating seniors (cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Honors study is noted on College transcripts. Honors Seminars are offered occasionally by members of the Maryville College faculty. Honors seminars may be special sections of regular course offerings, or they may cover topics not regularly a part of the College curriculum. Honors seminars may be electives, major courses (if approved by the academic division chair), or general education courses (if approved by the Chair of the Core Curriculum). Honors seminars are listed in the Schedule of Courses with enrollment normally limited to 15 students. Honors Study within Existing Courses permits students of superior ability to pursue honors study in courses in which they are registered. The honors work goes beyond basic course requirements and may take the form of additional reading, writing, experimentation or creative work, performance or any combination of these. For successful completion of honors study in an existing course, students receive one additional credit hour beyond the regular credit allotment for the course. Arrangements for honors study are negotiated with the course instructor and require the approval of the relevant academic division chair(s). The arrangements must be reported to the Registrar no later than the first week of the course. Honors Tutorial Practica are programs of tutoring and/or other appropriate academic work with faculty under the coordination of the Academic Support Center staff. Each practicum in this special program is awarded one credit hour and the course may be repeated to a maximum of four credit hours. With the permission of the instructor, the practicum may be taken on a non- credit basis. Satisfactory completion of Honors Tutorial Training is a prerequisite to all Honors Tutorial Practica. Individualized Majors Students pursuing a B.A. degree may design a Major. A formal application and approval of the Committee on Individualized Instruction are required. Individualized majors must include: One primary subject area 18 credit hours Related subject area 12 credit hours Senior Study 3-6 credit hours A faculty sponsor in each subject area is required. Applications are available in the Registrar’s Office. Maryville College also offers a separate Interdisciplinary Major, with requirements listed in the Interdisciplinary Major section of the Catalog. Individualized Study Courses Students who wish to pursue a topic in their major that is not available through a regular catalog course may request a program of individualized reading or experimental work. The academic division chair will consider requests on the basis of the appropriateness of the topic and availability of faculty for supervision. Such a course may be an additional course in the major or, when appropriate, may substitute for a major course. Such coursework carries a 350 number and students may not earn more than three credit hours through individualized study courses. Students must have at least junior standing. Such a program is pursued under the guidance of a faculty member, who confers regularly 58| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 with the student and assesses the program. Approval by the academic division chair is required, and an additional fee of $50 per credit hour is charged. Internships Students gain practical experience in their major field of study through internships. These supervised experiences provide students opportunities to apply knowledge and skills in an operational setting, while testing interest in a particular profession. Settings for professional opportunities include academic institutions, government agencies, private companies, commercial and philanthropic organizations, and opportunities abroad. Though internships are typically pursued for academic credit, the Career Center and the Center for Global Engagement may also arrange non-credit opportunities. All academic divisions are required to follow guidelines as published in this Catalog and divisional guidelines that more specifically define the experiences. In order to make the most of these experiences, students receive mentoring and preparation that supports positive outcomes for both students and internship sites. The mentoring and preparatory process is provided by the faculty advisor/internship coordinator in some majors and in other majors is provided Career Center staff. Students and supervisors must follow procedures related to application and approval of the experience, the range of accepted experiences, methods of reporting and verifying experiences, and the duties of the faculty supervisor and the internship site supervisor. Students may enroll in internships in the fall, spring, or summer terms. Although tuition or a fee is required for all such experiences to be listed on the transcript, summer internship tuition is discounted for credit bearing internships. Summer internships for zero credit hours are available to students who are using the experience in fulfilling their Maryville College Works significant practical experience (SPE) requirement. Although students are required to register for them, there is no tuition required. Students must register for the internship courses prior to the internship experience and the activity must take place in the term for which the students are registered for them. Internship experiences (courses numbered 337) are allotted 0 to 15 credit hours and are intended to give students significant practical experiences in a work, service, or research setting. Credit earned for internships is allocated in proportion to the scope and duration of the experience. Divisional guidelines for internships vary, but for each credit hour granted, students are expected to be involved in at least 45 hours of approved activity. Approved activity may include time spent at the internship site, as well as structured goal setting, reflective assignments, and meetings with the designated on-campus supervisor. The duration should normally occur over a minimum of three weeks. Zero-credit hour internships can only be done once and must be undertaken as the significant practical experience (SPE) of Maryville College Works. Furthermore, the zero-credit option requires a minimum of at least 45 hours of approved activity for a duration of a minimum of three weeks. Internships are graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis. Internships that satisfy a major requirement must meet the required credit hours specified for that major. While all majors offer internships, some major fields restrict enrollment in internships to students majoring in the field; therefore, special qualifications or circumstances may warrant application to the appropriate academic division chair for a waiver permitting enrollment by a non- major. Remuneration may be permitted insofar as Catalog and Divisional guidelines for the learning experience are followed and faculty supervisors work closely with organizations and internship site supervisors to protect students and ensure the quality of the experience as an extension of the College curriculum. Application and Approval Process 1. Internship applications, approval processes, supervisory, and evaluation forms are available through Handshake. Department/divisions may have additional required paperwork. 2. The initial application for an internship is to be submitted to and approved by the designated internship supervisor prior to the proposed experience. 3. The application is to include: a. The credit hour value proposed for the experience b. The name of the Maryville College faculty supervisor c. The name, work address and phone number of the internship site supervisor d. The site address of the experience e. An explanation of the content of the internship, Academic Procedures and Regulations| 59 objectives of the experience, and relevance to the student’s degree program and professional goals f. A description of the types of experiences likely to be encountered, and the specific methods and materials to be used in the evaluation of performance, (e.g., journal, paper, seminar, exam) g. The signed approval of the faculty supervisor h. A learning agreement form signed by the internship site supervisor that outlines the proposed internship arrangement, evaluation processes, and proposed list of the student’s duties. Student Responsibilities 1. Regularly reports progress to the staff or faculty supervisor, 2. Follows all guidelines of the internship site supervisor, 3. Adheres to all other guidelines and stipulations specified in the approved application. Supervisor Responsibilities The Staff/Faculty Supervisor: 1. Assists in the application process; 2. Communicates regularly with the student regarding progress, difficulties, successes and the evaluation criteria; 3. Contacts the internship site supervisor periodically to monitor student progress; 4. Evaluates performance and materials based on the evaluation criteria and on the assessment of the site supervisor, and assigns the final grade. Internship Site Supervisor: 1. Signs the learning agreement containing a list of the student's proposed duties and agrees to the supervisory role and evaluation process; 2. Ensures learning experiences congruent with those outlined in the approved application; 3. Responds to inquiries from the faculty supervisor regarding the student's progress; 4. Completes mid-term and final evaluation forms provided through surveys. Method(s) of Evaluation Methods and materials to be used for evaluation are proposed in the original application along with the final date due, as well as addressed specifically in the internship course syllabus. Typically, these will consist of the evaluation of the site supervisor, various assignments completed throughout the semester, and a verification of hours completed. Once the internship is completed, the faculty or staff supervisor and instructor of record review all required materials and issue the grade. Termination The internship can be immediately terminated for cause upon request of either the site or the faculty supervisor with the approval of the division chair. Life Enrichment Program The Maryville College Life Enrichment Program (MCLEP or “portfolio”) is a means to enrich and diversify students’ educational experience through a combination of curricular and co- curricular activities. In the program students work closely with a faculty or staff mentor to identify or design projects appropriate for their personal growth. Through completion of an individually designed project, students earn one credit hour. The projects must fall into one of the following categories: • wellness • leadership • creative/aesthetic works • cross-cultural experience, or • citizenship (e.g., service and community involvement) Expected outcomes include some of the following: an enriched life, an integration of experiences, discovery, deeper development, and transformation. A central feature of each project is the maintenance of a personal journal, the purposes of which are to encourage careful observation and reflection and to deepen knowledge of oneself. Ordinarily, only one credit hour may be earned in any category, and no more than three credit hours may be earned in the program. One project may be taken for credit in a semester. The program is available only during the fall and spring semesters, except for portfolios related to cross- cultural experience with permission of the International 60| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 Programming Committee. Under certain circumstances and conditions, it is possible to earn more than one education abroad-related portfolio credit in a cross-cultural experience. These circumstances include credit for an embedded education abroad program or a cross-cultural project that takes place during any academic session that students study abroad. Contact Kirsten Sheppard at 865-273-8991. A special portfolio project in self-management is required of first year-in-college students placed on academic probation following the first fall semester (See section on Probation and Suspension (p. 56)). First-year students admitted through the Academic Success Program must satisfactorily complete a portfolio in academic self- management during the first two semesters (0.5 credit hours each semester). Contact the Director of the Academic Support Center for more information. Senior Study The Senior Study is described under Degree Requirements in this catalog. In addition to prerequisites specified for the major, a student ordinarily should hold at least junior standing and have passed ENG 120 and the English Proficiency Examination before beginning the Senior Study. A student may satisfy the requirement earlier, conditional on the above requirements, appropriate prior coursework and training, a 3.5 GPA, the permission of the academic advisor, proposed Senior Study advisor and division chair. The full project receives from 3 to 6 credit hours, over one to two semesters, depending on the major. Student Classification Students are classified as full-time or part-time, as degree candidates or special students, and according to class standing. Students registered for a minimum of 12 hours a semester are classified as full-time. Those registered for fewer than 12 credit hours are classified as part-time. Degree candidates are those recognized by the College as pursuing studies leading to a baccalaureate degree at Maryville College. Special students are not recognized as degree candidates, though they do receive full credit for academic work completed with passing grades. The status of special student may be chosen by any student who does not plan to apply for a Maryville degree, or it may result from action of the College if the academic record does not warrant degree candidacy. Class standing is determined by the number of credit hours earned. The minimum requirements for class standings above the first-year level are as follows: For sophomore standing, 30 credit hours For junior standing, 60 credit hours For senior standing, 90 credit hours Transfer Credit Students who want to complete coursework at another accredited college or university in any academic term must obtain prior approval by the corresponding Division or Core Chair. A Transfer Credit Pre-Approval Form must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office no later than the end of classes in the semester before attendance at another institution begins. Unless courses are pre-approved, transfer credit cannot be guaranteed. Generally, academic courses in which the student has earned a grade of “C” or above will be transferred and applied toward graduation requirements. College credits earned by students while they were enrolled in high school will be evaluated upon receipt of an official college transcript. See the Credit by Examination (p. 47) section of this Catalog for information related to transferability of credit earned through external testing programs. Withdrawal and Leave of Absence The various ways you may be withdrawn from a course or the College are included in this section. Use the links below to find more detailed information and procedures for: Course Drop/Course Withdrawal (W) (p. 62) – within first 8 days of semester, during the \"W\" period, after the \"W\" deadline, course withdrawal for medical reasons College Withdrawal (WD) (p. 63) – student-initiated withdrawal, medical withdrawal, administrative withdrawal Leave of Absence (LOA) (p. 60) – regular LOA, emergency temporary LOA, reinstatement Leave of Absence - Registration and Reinstatement Students who wish to leave the College temporarily (excluding summers) for academic, medical, religious, or military service-related reasons may request a Leave of Absence for a specific period of time. Leave of absence is Academic Procedures and Regulations| 61 meant for students who plan to complete a Maryville College degree but who have a need to be away from their Maryville College studies for an extended period. Leave of Absence is distinct from both withdrawal from the College and suspension from it. Typically, it is arranged in advance of the semester for which it is granted. It is usually not granted for a semester once that semester is underway, although it may be granted for the following semester. Some situations (e.g., those created by military deployment or health-related reasons) may call for leaves granted during a relevant semester. Leaves are usually approved for one semester and may be extended to one year with approval of the Committee on Academic Standing. An exception to this general rule is made for leaves granted so that students may complete the second part of a dual degree program at other partner institutions, in which case the standard leave time is two years. In most cases, a Leave of Absence may not exceed a cumulative total of two years. Leave of Absence may not end during a semester that is in progress. Applications for Leave of Absence must be submitted to the Registrar. Leaves of Absence must be requested at least three weeks before the beginning of the term during which the student wants to be absent from the College. Requests for unexpected leaves must be made as soon as possible and are not considered or approved retroactively. Students who do not return after the specific term of the Leave of Absence will be withdrawn retroactive to their leave date and may face financial consequences. Leaves of more than 180 days may also have financial consequences. Students in multiple majors may not request a leave of absence status from only one program. International students should also contact the Center for Global Engagement to discuss eligibility and potential visa issues. As noted above, the College recognizes four kinds of leave of absence: academic, medical, religious, and military: Application for a leave of absence for academic reasons is granted only for the purpose of academic enrichment. Typically, this will be for completion of the non-Maryville College portion of a dual degree program (for example, a 3-2 Engineering program). The student’s academic advisor must certify that the student has completed all Maryville College-specific requirements of the dual degree program and is ready to move on to the second part of the dual degree program. In the case of academically motivated leaves taken for reasons other than the completion of a dual degree program, students taking courses elsewhere while on Leave of Absence must obtain division approval in advance for any course to be used as transfer credit for degree completion. Students and advisors should bear in mind that there are rules governing the minimum number of hours which must be completed at the College for a Maryville College degree, and certain requirements which must be satisfied on campus. Study abroad under the auspices of Maryville College is managed through Overseas Study registration and is not addressed by this policy. A student taking Leave of Absence registration in order to complete a dual degree program has the option to participate in Commencement, ordinarily at the point at which the student completes the minimum number of hours for a Maryville College degree. The actual degree will not be awarded until the official transcript has been received from the partner institution and the required transfer credit has been awarded. Students taking academic Leave of Absence from the College in order to complete the non-Maryville College portion of a dual degree program may choose to live in College residence halls, depending on the availability of space, in accordance with Maryville College rules and the College’s schedule. Accordingly, they would also participate in a College meal plan. Normal room and board fees will apply, and the needs of enrolled students will take precedence in the allotment of rooms. Students taking academic Leave of Absence for dual degree programs may also continue to use other facilities and services normally available to registered students, such as health services, the post office, email and printing accounts, sports passes, etc., to participate in College-sponsored events open to all College students, and (where consistent with the requirements of dual degree partners) participate in College-sponsored student activities such as ensembles and team sports. The College will decide upon suitable student fees to support these activities on a yearly basis. The use of College rooms, facilities, and/or services and participation in College-sponsored student activities are not allowed to students on Leave of Absence for any reason other than the completion of dual degree programs. Application for a medical-related Leave of Absence must be accompanied by medical documentation in support of the leave and in support of readiness to return, as feasible under the circumstances. Medical Leave of Absence differs from medical withdrawal, in that medical Leave of Absence is better suited to students who are proactively seeking to address their health issues by taking an entire semester off, or in any case who have some sense of when they expect to be back. Medical withdrawal is better suited 62| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 to students who encounter unexpected health problems that make it impossible for them to continue their studies or impossible to finish a semester. Application for Leave of Absence for religious reasons is suitable for religious obligations that are of an extended character and that would make it impossible for a student to succeed during a semester. It is not given for recurring observances that take less than a semester to fulfill (such as, for example, Lent, Easter, Ramadan, or Eid) but for longer term obligations, such as pilgrimage or extended mission trips. Application for a Leave of Absence due to a military call to active duty is granted when accompanied by a copy of relevant military orders, at the time a student is required to stop attending classes. Other types of leaves may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Students returning from an approved Leave of Absence are not required to apply for readmission but instead need only submit a “return to campus” notification to the Registrar’s Office by April 1 for a Fall Semester return or November 1 for the following Spring Semester. Reinstatement is never guaranteed or automatic. The College reserves the right to require additional documentation that the student is qualified and ready to return. Decisions regarding financial aid are made separately from the reinstatement process. See Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence (ETLOA) (p. 62) for policy and procedures for granting a brief absence during the semester. Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence A student may be granted an Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence (ETLOA) for a period not to exceed two consecutive weeks at one time, within an academic semester. Each request will be reviewed on an individualized basis and may require appropriate documentation to support the request. Additional time may be granted, when medically indicated. Requests for an emergency temporary leave of absence will be reviewed and approved by the Vice President & Dean of Students and communicated to the Assistant Academic Dean for a specified period of time. An emergency temporary leave of absence may be applicable for students who must be absent for mental and/or physical health reasons, or any other personal or family emergency. Failure to attend classes by the return date specified on the emergency temporary leave of absence form may result in an administrative withdrawal from the College. Students are encouraged to consult with appropriate offices regarding the applicability of an emergency temporary leave of absence. Examples of such consultations may include, but are not limited to, conversations with the Title IX Coordinator, Disability Resources & Accessibility staff, Director of Prevention Education, Counseling Center staff, and/or academic advisor. Students may submit their request via email, by contacting the Dean of Students office during College business hours. When feasible, students should seek approval of the emergency temporary leave of absence prior to the start of the absence. However, the College is aware that extenuating circumstances may exist in emergency situations where such prior approval is not feasible. In rare circumstances when the student is unable to initiate a request for Emergency Temporary LOA, the Dean of Students can initiate the process. Course Drop/Course Withdrawal If you are considering dropping or withdrawing from a course, the first step is to talk to your academic advisor or talk to the instructor. If you decide to drop or withdraw from a course, which process you follow depends on the timing. It is important to note that deciding not to attend class does not constitute a withdrawal from a course. Withdrawal is official on the day the Schedule Adjustment Form, properly signed, is returned by the student to the Registrar. Dropping a course – during the “Drop/Add” period at the beginning of the term When this applies: Within first 8 days of classes in fall or spring (Day 2 for 3-week terms, Day 3 for 5-week terms, Day 6 for 11-week terms) How to drop a course: Go into your Self Service account, drop the desired course, and submit it for advisor approval. Once the advisor approves the request, you will be dropped from the roster. The course will not show up on the transcript as an attempted course and the hours dropped with not be included in the total attempted hours for the semester. Withdrawing from a course – after “Drop/Add” period Academic Procedures and Regulations| 63 and before the “W” deadline When this applies: From Day 9 through the 45th day of classes for fall or spring (Days 3-9 for 3-week terms, Days 4-21 for 5-week terms, Days 7-33 for 11-week terms) How to withdraw from a course: Use the Schedule Adjustment Form on the Registrar website; this requires approvals from both the advisor and course instructor. Students are responsible for filing a completed Schedule Adjustment Form with the Registrar. The course will be shown on the transcript with a notation of “W” (withdrew) and the dropped hours will be included in the total hours attempted for the semester. Note: After the 45th day of classes for fall or spring (after Day 9 for 3-week terms, Day 21 for 5-week terms, Day 33 for 11-week terms), course withdrawal is not allowed. The grade earned for the course will be recorded on the transcript, and the hours are included in the total hours attempted. See Dates and Deadlines Requests for medical withdrawal from individual courses. Requests for medical withdrawal from individual courses are made to the Vice President and Dean of the College (Fayerweather Hall, Suite 309). This action is taken in only extreme cases and is viewed as a “last resort measure.” For a request to be considered, the following conditions must be satisfied: 1. The request is made before the last day of classes (before the examination period) in a given semester. 2. The student provides evidence that the medical condition has a singular and isolated effect in the individual class to the point that attendance and completion of requirements are not possible. The grade of “W” is recorded for each course affected. College Withdrawal Students may initiate withdrawal from the College, a medical withdrawal may be necessary, or a student may be withdrawn from the College by the Administration. An exit interview survey is part of the withdrawal process. Student-Initiated Withdrawal from the College Consult with your academic advisor if you are considering withdrawing from the College. Be sure you understand all the impacts of a decision to withdraw from the College, including your academic timeline, financial/financial aid implications, your personal and professional future, and the readmission (p. 13) process. International students must discuss their intent to withdraw from the College with the Director of the Center for Global Engagement prior to initiating a withdrawal process. Should you decide during the year or at the close of the year to terminate enrollment at Maryville College, the withdrawal procedure is as follows: 1. Report to the Registrar’s Office (Fayerweather Hall, Room 148) to initiate the process. The Registrar’s Office will provide you with the link to the Intent to Withdraw Form. 2. Once you complete the Intent to Withdraw Form, the Financial Aid Office, Bursar’s Office, Residence Life Office, and other relevant campus offices will be notified. Students are responsible for any balances due after the withdrawal is processed. Students are responsible for any costs incurred by the College, including collection and litigation costs. Refunds (p. 15), when appropriate, will be processed as promptly as possible. Students who do not follow official withdrawal procedures may forfeit their deposit. Withdrawal from the College, voluntarily or involuntarily, requires residential students to abide by the official check- out procedures. Resident students should vacate the room and leave campus within twenty-four hours after the Intent to Withdraw is completed. Failure to do this will result in an “improper check-out fee.” If a student is unable to withdraw in person, they may do so by notifying the Registrar’s Office and the Office of Student Affairs in writing. Medical Withdrawal for the College Requests for medical withdrawal from the College must be received no later than the last day of classes (before the examination period) and are made to the Vice President and Dean of Students (Student Affairs Office, Bartlett Hall, Rm. 327). For a request to be considered, the following conditions must be satisfied on or before the last 64| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 day of classes (before the examination period): 1. The student’s medical condition developed or became more serious during the semester in question. 2. The medical condition is significant to the point that it is the primary reason the student cannot attend classes and/or complete required work. 3. The student provides documentation that they are under the care of a licensed physician or licensed mental health professional. The grade of “W” is recorded for each course affected. Students withdrawing from the College under this policy are subject to the Charge Reduction Policy (p. 15). Requests for medical withdrawal from individual classes (p. 62) follows a separate process. Medical Leave of Absence differs from medical withdrawal in that medical Leave of Absence is better suited to students who are proactively seeking to address their health issues by taking an entire semester off, or in any case who have some sense of when they expect to be back. Medical withdrawal is better suited to students who encounter unexpected health problems that make it impossible for them to continue their studies or impossible to finish a semester. See the section on Leave of Absence (p. 60) for more information. Administrative Withdrawal Students may be administratively withdrawn from the College for failure to attend classes, for failure to pay their account, or as a result of a disciplinary process. Failure to Attend Classes: A complete administrative withdrawal from Maryville College may be initiated when a student ceases to attend all registered classes for a period of 10 consecutive business days, without prior approval, at any point within the regular semester. Such a withdrawal follows established College course withdrawal deadlines and associated charge reduction policies (p. 15). Prior to the course withdrawal deadline, administratively withdrawn students receive a grade of “W” in each enrolled course. After the course withdrawal deadline, administratively withdrawn students receive a grade of “F” in each enrolled course. The College will determine the withdrawal date if no notice is provided by the student. See Dates and Deadlines Withdrawal decisions may be appealed to the Vice President and Dean of the College or an appointed designee. All unpaid costs associated with attending the College remain the student’s responsibility after such a withdrawal. In addition, all College property in a student’s possession must be returned or the student may be charged for its full replacement value. Students living on-campus must arrange with the Office of Residence Life to vacate the property within a reasonable time as determined by residence life staff and appropriately checkout in order to avoid an improper checkout fee. In order to enroll in subsequent semesters, students who are administratively withdrawn from the College for non- attendance must apply for readmission. Non-Payment of Student Account: Maryville College administration reserves the right to withdraw a student at any point in the semester due to non-payment of their student account. The college may administratively withdraw a student from classes, remove a student from residence halls, and/or require conditions for continued enrollment when one of the following transpires: • A student fails to submit payment as indicated on a college approved deferment agreement. • A student misses at least 3 payments on an outside payment plan and the payment plan is cancelled. In these circumstances above, the Bursar in collaboration with the Controller and Vice President of Finance may administratively withdraw a student from classes, remove the student from Residence Halls, and/or place conditions on the student’s continued enrollment. The student will receive an opportunity to pay in full or establish suitable payment arrangements with the Bursar’s Office. All notification to the student will be in writing with payment options available and a set deadline for a required response. Students that do not respond by the established deadline will be Administratively Withdrawn as of that date. Students should be aware of the following impacts of administrative withdrawal for non-payment: A. Students that are withdrawn due to College Initiated Administrative Withdrawal for Non-Payment will either have their schedule dropped or receive a “W” for all courses attempted during the semester. The “W” will be reflected on the student’s official transcript. B. Students that are withdrawn are subject to the College’s Academic Procedures and Regulations| 65 Charge Reduction Policy (p. 15). C. Students that wish to return to Maryville College the next semester will be required to apply for readmission (p. 13). All previous balances must be paid in full prior to readmission to the College. D. A Balance Hold will be placed on the student’s account until any balance is paid in full. This will prohibit viewing of grades, release of transcripts, and registration for classes. E. Students that are administratively withdrawn due to non-payment and are residential students will have 24 hours to vacate their residence hall and return any keys to the College Residence Life staff. Students needing more than 24 hours to vacate their Residence Hall can work with the Residence Life staff for assistance. The officials responsible for this policy are the VP of Finance, Controller, and Bursar. Questions can be addressed to the Business Office. Disciplinary Action: Students may face administrative withdrawal as the result of a disciplinary process for academic integrity or conduct. See the Academic Integrity (p. 41) section of the Catalog and the Conduct section of the Student Handbook for more information. 66| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 Graduation Requirements for Undergraduate Programs Basic Requirements Maryville College is committed to liberal learning in order to prepare students for a satisfying and successful life. Thus, recipients of any of the College’s degrees have been immersed in the breadth of the Maryville Curriculum, experiencing the interconnectedness of knowledge and exploration. At Maryville College, the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree offers a broad-based program which is well suited for persons seeking a high degree of flexibility and greater interdisciplinary exploration. The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Music (B.M.) degrees are designed to provide students with deeper experience in a particular discipline or field. For specific careers or graduate programs, there may be a preference for the B.A., B.M., or the B.S. degree. Students should choose which degree to pursue based on their particular circumstances and goals. To receive the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music or the Bachelor of Science degree, the student must complete all requirements for that degree specified in the catalog in effect at the time of initial enrollment. For any of the three degrees, a minimum of 120 semester-hours of credit must be earned with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00. In addition, for all courses taken to satisfy major requirements for all degrees, a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00 must be earned in the major (2.75 for all educator preparation majors). The courses taken must satisfy all core, major, and major-related requirements. In addition, students must complete the Maryville College Works program as well as pass the English proficiency examination. Every candidate for a degree is expected to pursue his or her program of studies in residence at Maryville, especially in meeting general education and major requirements. If circumstances warrant, permission may be granted for non- resident credit. Approval of the appropriate academic division chairperson, Chair of Core Curriculum and the Registrar is required in advance. With rare exceptions, the following core curriculum domains must be completed by means of credit earned through Maryville College: U.S. Pluralism, Culture and Intercultural Dynamics, and Ethical Citizenship in the World. In addition, as a minimum, each degree candidate must complete at Maryville College 42 credit hours, including 20 in the senior year and nine in the major field. These credit hours must be earned in regular courses taught at the College and may not include internships, student teaching, or credit by examination. An exception to the senior year requirement is made for students in cooperative degree programs who spend the senior year in residence at the cooperating institution. It is the student's responsibility to understand and meet the requirements for graduation. The Maryville Curriculum A broadly based educational experience defines the liberal arts college. All students, regardless of major field, are required to complete the requirements described in the \"Undergraduate Programs of Study\" section of this Catalog headed 'The Maryville Curriculum, General Education'. Maryville College Works Maryville College is committed to enhancing student learning through implementation of Maryville College Works: Bridging College to Career. The goal of the program is to prepare students for lives of engaged professionalism by challenging them to investigate and explore future professional opportunities within the framework of the liberal arts tradition. Prominent features of the program are its emphasis on vocational discernment and career development and preparation as well as completion of a significant practical experience. These planned experiences may take the form of an internship, an approved semester of education abroad, an appropriate Senior Study, a semester of student teaching or another approved format. The program focuses on three over-arching student learning outcomes: 1. Students will acquire the knowledge to complete a personal vocation and career preparation and completion plan. 2. Students will participate in a significant practical experience. 3. Students will articulate how their educational Undergraduate Degree Requirements Undergraduate Degree Requirements| 67 experience and their significant practical experience apply to their professional opportunities. Students who transfer at least 45 credit hours are exempt from the requirement as are students completing dual degree programs in Biopharmaceutical Sciences, Biological Sciences with a Pre-Veterinary Tract, Nursing, and Engineering. These students may voluntarily participate in any or all program elements. The means by which the student learning outcomes are addressed and achieved are integrated into an incremental and cohesive program spanning four years that includes first-year seminars, disciplinary professional development courses, academic and career advising, learning modules related to career preparation, and a final reflection. Specific requirements for the program include: • Completion of a career-related career assessment and discussion of results with academic advisor. • Planning and engaging in a significant practical experience. • Completion of a career readiness educational program. • Submission of a final reflection. To satisfy this program, students will complete FYS 110, a 299/399 course, a 337 course, and MCW 400 course, or approved equivalents. Senior Study One of the distinctive features of a Maryville education is the Senior Study: The Undergraduate Research and Creative Expression Program of Maryville College. Every degree candidate completes such a project in the major field, under the guidance of a faculty supervisor. The Senior Study facilitates the scholarship of discovery, creativity or engagement within the major field and integrates those methods with the educational goals fostered through the Core Curriculum. Within guidelines established by the academic divisions and in consultation with division faculty, the subject of the project is of the student’s choosing and can take various forms, such as literary, scientific, or historical investigation; laboratory, studio or field work; an interpretive effort; or a creative activity. The Senior Study requirement allows students to exercise initiative, plan and complete a substantial piece of work, and gain the confidence and pride that comes from accomplishment. Depending on the major field, Senior Study may account for three to six credit hours toward graduation. Other regulations governing Senior Study may be found in the Academic Procedures and Regulations (p. 41) section of this catalog. Placement Assessments First time, first year, and many transfer students take one or more placement assessments to ensure appropriate placement in course sequences. 1. Initial placement in mathematics is based on students’ ACT/SAT Math score and/or transcript. Students may then choose to complete an online math review and assessment to improve their placement. Students with an ACT score of 18 or below (SAT 510 or below) will be placed in Fundamentals Mathematics (MTH 105). Unless students demonstrate proficiency by testing out of this course, they must successfully complete MTH 105 before continuing in college-level mathematics or statistics. This course prepares students for college-level work and offers three institutional credits for satisfactory completion; the credits do not count toward the minimum needed for graduation. Regardless of standardized and placement test results, Maryville College accepts for credit those courses in the mathematical sciences taken through dual enrollment, AP, or IB (An AP exam score of 4 or 5 grants credit hours associated with course content – refer to the Advanced Placement (p. 13) section in this catalog). Dual enrollment courses must be passed with a grade of C or higher to receive transfer credit. 2. Students will receive a preliminary placement in composition based on their ACT English score or SAT Writing score. This placement may be adjusted in the following ways: a. Students with a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Examination in either English Language and Composition or English Literature and Composition earn credit for English 110: Composition and Speech I. b. Students with an AP score of 4 or 5 on both English Language and Composition and English Literature and Composition earn credit for ENG 110: Composition and Speech and ENG 160: Early Western Literature Tradition. c. Students with an AP score of 4 or 5 on AP Research earn credit for English 120: Composition and Speech II and are not required to take either English 110: Composition and Speech I or English 150: Oral Rhetoric. 68| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 d. Credit earned through dual enrollment or transfer from an accredited institution in Composition I or the equivalent course, with a grade of C or higher, is accepted for English 110: Composition and Speech. e. Credit earned through dual enrollment or transfer from an accredited institution for both Composition II (and the equivalent) and a course in public speaking, with grades of C or higher, is accepted for English 120: Composition and Speech II. f. Credit earned through dual enrollment or transfer from an accredited institution with a grade of C or higher for Composition II is accepted for English 120: Composition and Speech II. Students with this credit who do not have course credit in public speaking must take English 150: Oral Rhetoric. g. Credit earned through dual enrollment or transfer from an accredited institution with a grade of C or higher for a course in public speaking (without a course in Composition II), is accepted for English 150: Oral Rhetoric, but students must take English 120: Composition and Speech II. Students whose ACT English scores or SAT Writing scores fall within selected ranges may take a challenge exam to attempt to place into the next higher level. Students who by means of the written challenge exam successfully place out of the writing portion of English 120 will be given the further opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in giving a five-minute speech (informative or argumentative) with oral citation of sources; passing this public speaking exam will result in exemption from English 120 (but not credit hours for it). For the student who has passed the written portion of the English 120 challenge exam, if there is room in an existing section of English 150: Oral Rhetoric, then the student may opt to take English 150 instead of taking the oral portion of the challenge exam. 3. All students are required to take a second language placement assessment unless fewer than 2 years (3-4 semesters) of the chosen language were completed in high school. In this case, the student may enroll in an introductory second language course (ASL CHN, FRN, GER, GRK, ITA, JPN, LAT, or SPN). Students with language proficiency developed through other means, including native proficiency, should complete the assessment or contact the chair of the Division of Languages and Literatures for an individual assessment. The results of the placement assessment may qualify a student for exemption from the second language requirement. However, placements are binding and students may not enroll in a level lower than that into which they are placed unless an exception is approved by the language coordinator or the division chair. Also, the language placement exam is intended for initial assessment of ability and may not be repeated for the purpose of accelerating progress through a course of study already begun at the college, unless permission is given by the language coordinator or the division chair. Regardless of the results of the placement assessment, Maryville College accepts for elective credit those courses in a second language taken through dual enrollment, AP, or IB (An AP exam score of 4 or 5 grants three credit hours). Dual enrollment courses must be passed with a grade of C or higher. 4. Students desiring to enroll in Chemistry will initially be placed in Chemistry 111: Fundamentals of Chemistry or Chemistry 121: General Chemistry according to ACT math scores or other Chemistry readiness assessment. Students may appeal their placement with Dr. Mary Turner, Chemistry Coordinator or with Dr. Jennifer Brigati, Chair of Natural Science. English Proficiency Examination In coursework and personal relations, each student is steadily encouraged to develop the capacity to communicate effectively in written and spoken English. That capacity must also be demonstrated through satisfactory performance on an English proficiency examination, required of every student. The examination is given in both English 110 and English 120. The examination consists of an essay on a topic either chosen from a group of topics of current interest in English 110 or assigned by the English 120 instructor in connection with the student’s research on a topic for debate. The essay is evaluated by two or more graders, who consider its organization, grammatical correctness, clarity, and overall quality. Students who pass the exam in English 110 will be excused from taking it in English 120. Students earning a grade of Unsatisfactory on the exam in either English 110 or English 120 will be enrolled in English 121: Syntax for Writing for the next semester, regardless of whether they are taking or retaking English 110 or 120 in that semester. Incoming students bringing transfer or dual enrollment credit or AP credit for the equivalent of Composition II, and therefore exempted from English 120, will be enrolled Undergraduate Degree Requirements| 69 in English 121: Syntax for Writing, at the start of which the English Proficiency Exam will be administered. Students earning a grade of Satisfactory in that sitting of the exam will be exempted from the course, and the passing grade of Satisfactory on the English Proficiency Exam will be recorded on the transcript. Students earning a grade of Unsatisfactory on that sitting of the exam will continue in the course, with an opportunity to retake the exam within the course. A student who fails the English Proficiency Exam within the course must repeat the course in subsequent semesters until the exam is passed. All students must pass the exam before enrolling in Senior Study, the culmination of work in the major field. For a student who passes the written portion of the English 120 challenge exam, that exam will be accepted in lieu of the English Proficiency Exam, and the grade of Satisfactory for the English Proficiency Exam will be recorded on the student’s transcript. Majors As a degree requirement, each student completes an approved program of concentrated study in a major field. The major is commonly taken in a single discipline, along with several courses in related subjects. Some majors are interdisciplinary. An individualized major may be designed, however, to meet particular educational needs (refer to the Individualized Major (p. 57) section in this Catalog). We also have dual degree programs (described below) that involve cooperative agreements with other accredited academic institutions, and degrees from both Maryville College and the cooperating institution are awarded. A disciplinary major consists of a minimum of 30 semester hours in a single discipline including three to six hours devoted to a Senior Study. In the B.A. and the B.S., the major may not require more than 50 hours in a single discipline (i.e. a single three-letter course designation). The B.A. involves a maximum of 56 hours in all major and related subjects. However, the educator preparation track within some majors may exceed the 56-hour limit because of the addition of professional courses. The B.S. involves a maximum of 70 hours in major and related courses. For an individualized major, possible only with the B.A. and B.S. degrees, at least 18 hours in one subject, 12 hours in a related subject, and six hours in Senior Study are required; approval of the Committee on Individualized Instruction must also be obtained. Students may select a major by the end of the first college year, but the selection may wait until the sophomore year in some fields. Postponement of the choice beyond the sophomore year, or a subsequent change of field, is likely to delay graduation beyond the normal four years. Students planning to pursue a major in a highly structured program, where the sequence of courses is an important consideration, are encouraged to confer with the appropriate academic division chair early in the first year of enrollment. Such fields include the foreign languages, natural sciences, mathematics, teacher education, physical education, and the cooperative programs in engineering and nursing. Permission of the academic division chair must be secured in order to major in any field. Approval must be registered on the proper form filed by the advisor with the College Registrar. Continuation in the major is contingent upon satisfactory academic performance. Substitutions for required major courses are granted only in rare instances and require the written approval of the division chair. For all courses taken to satisfy major requirements for all degrees, a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00 must be earned (2.75 for all educator preparation majors). Degrees Offered: Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Music Bachelor of Science Cooperative, Dual Degree Majors The fields from which majors for the Bachelor of Arts degree may be selected are (for detailed program descriptions, see \"Undergraduate Programs of Study\"): Accounting (See Finance/Accounting) American Sign Language and Deaf Studies* American Sign Language-English Interpreting Art Biochemistry Biological Sciences with a Pre-Veterinary Sciences Track/Veterinary Medicine Biology* Biomedical Sciences Biopharmaceutical Sciences Chemistry* Computer Science Counseling (See Track in Psychology) Criminal Justice Developmental Psychology Design Economics Elementary Education Engineering English* Environmental Studies Finance/Accounting Health and Wellness Promotion 70| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 Health Care (Nursing) History* Human Resource Management Interdisciplinary Major International Business International Studies Management Marketing Mathematics* Music Outdoor Studies and Tourism Philosophy Physical Education/Health* Political Science Psychology Religion Sign Language Interpreting (See American Sign Language-English Interpreting) Sociology Spanish* Teaching English as a Second Language* Theatre Studies* Writing Communication *Educator Preparation Track available The fields from which majors for the Bachelor of Music degree may be selected are (for detailed program descriptions, see \"Undergraduate Programs of Study\"): Music Education (Vocal-General and Instrumental)* Performance (Piano and Vocal) Theory-Composition *Educator Preparation Track available The fields from which majors for the Bachelor of Science degree may be selected are (for detailed program descriptions, see \"Undergraduate Programs of Study\"): Biology Biochemistry Biomedical Sciences Business Analytics Chemistry Environmental Science Exercise Science Mathematics Neuroscience Cooperative, Dual Degree Major Programs Engineering Health Care/Nursing Biopharmaceutical Sciences/Pharmacy Biological Sciences/Veterinary Medicine The cooperative, dual-degree in Engineering normally involves three years at Maryville College before transfer to the cooperating institution. Maryville College maintains formal agreements with several universities. The cooperative, dual-degree program in Health Care/Nursing involves two years at Maryville College and two years at nearby Tennessee Wesleyan University (TWU). After program completion the B.A. in Health Care is received from Maryville College and the B.S.N. is received from TWU. The cooperative, dual-degree in Biopharmaceutical Sciences/Pharmacy normally involves three years at Maryville College and four years at the College of Pharmacy at the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Centers in Knoxville and Memphis or the East Tennessee State University Gatton College of Pharmacy in Johnson City. The B.A. in Biopharmaceutical Sciences is received from Maryville College after successful completion of the first year of pharmacy school. The program of study leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in Biological Sciences with a Pre-Veterinary Sciences Track from Maryville College and to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine consists of three academic years at Maryville followed by four academic years at UTCVM. For detailed dual degree program descriptions, see \"Undergraduate Programs of Study\" Minors - optional While there is no requirement to do so, any student may elect to complete one or more minor fields. The minor option allows students to study an area of secondary interest in some depth, and to have that study listed on the academic record. The secondary field may be of a vocational or cultural interest, or may serve to diversify preparation and enhance career opportunities. A minor consists of at least 15 credit hours in a subject and involves significant coursework above the 100-level. Minors in second languages require 15 credit hours above the 100-level. Only courses in which a grade of “C-” or better is earned are counted toward minor requirements. If a minor is desired, students should make early plans to schedule the appropriate courses. Because minors are not required and the demand for courses is uncertain, regular offerings of all courses for every minor cannot be guaranteed. Specific requirements for each minor are found in departmental listings. Undergraduate Degree Requirements| 71 In certain fields, a minor may serve as an additional endorsement for educator preparation. Minor requirements for additional endorsements are available from academic advisors in the subject areas and may vary from the requirement for a standard minor. Minors may be taken in most fields in which a major is offered. In addition, minors are also available in the following areas in which majors are not offered: Accounting American Studies Analytics Appalachian Studies Business Child Trauma and Resilience Community Psychology Fermentation Sciences Gender and Women’s Studies Humanities Medieval Studies Relationships and Sexual Health Statistics Sustainability Studies Navigate to \"Undergraduate Programs of Study\" section for detailed descriptions of minors. Certificate Programs Certificate programs provide opportunities to take a group of related courses to focus on a particular field or set of skills. Shorter than undergraduate degree programs, students can pursue a certificate program while completing their undergraduate degree. Certificates may help students secure employment after graduation. Maryville College offers three certificate programs: Global+ (p. 71) Ministry and Church Leadership (p. 72) Certified Nonprofit Professional (p. 73) Global+ Certificate Program Kirsten Sheppard, Director, Center for Global Engagement and Coordinator The Global+ Certificate Program is designed to foster the skills, habits, and mindset of global competence. Global competence is the capacity to understand and appreciate local and global issues, diverse perspectives and world views, and interact appropriately and effectively with people from different cultures and identities. The Global Plus Certificate program offers a valuable additional credential to the student’s academic program in a package that is quite accessible and attainable. This program allows students from any major to achieve global competency while pursuing their chosen field. Specifically, student outcomes include learning to: Think globally: students will have an increased knowledge of their relationship to the world; think about issues from a global perspective; gain an appreciation for other world cultures, viewpoints, and perspectives. Communicate effectively: students will improve their foreign language skills and their ability to communicate with people across cultural and language divides. Contribute responsibly: students will take action by using their global knowledge to interact and build relationships with people from other cultures; demonstrate respect, open-mindedness, understanding and flexibility in behavior and ways of thinking; help others to embrace multiple perspectives. Certificate Requirements Requirements List GLOBAL+ CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS: The Global+ Certificate is awarded to students who fulfill a prescribed set of requirements. These requirements include three main elements: coursework, co-curricular global engagement, and global experience. More specifically, these three elements are: 1. Coursework 9 credit hours including the following: INT 201: Contemporary Global Issues (3 hrs.) 2 Global+ designated courses (GL+)––these may include language above the 100-level (6 hrs.) NOTE: Global+ students are encouraged to take the INT- section of MCW 400: Senior Year Seminar. 2. Co-Curricular Global Engagement a.

Global Experience (International or Domestic**) Participation in a Global+ approved program: Option 1: Study Abroad (travel study, 3+ week summer, semester or year) Option 2: Internship or Community Engagement Abroad Option 3: US-based program with a global and/or language focus **If an undergraduate student is unable to travel abroad, the student can fulfill this requirement through Study Away study or internship opportunities. *NOTE: At least 1 Global+ designated course or the global experience should focus on a non-Western culture or country. The International Programming Committee approves programs and may collaborate with academic departments and the Career Center for programs/experiences that are simultaneously fulfilling the GL+ requirements and Maryville College Works, major requirements, or scholarship requirements. Internships pursued for credit must follow all procedures and meet all requirements of academic departments. International Internships must also follow protocols established by the Center for Global Engagement. Certificate requirements may be satisfied by internships with or without academic credit, and may be paid or unpaid. Ministry and Church Leadership Certificate Program Jessica Lewis, College Chaplain and Director of Campus Ministry The Certificate Program in Ministry and Church Leadership is designed to equip students with a set of intellectual and practical skills that will help to prepare them for future work in ministry. Though this program is not a substitute for later professional or graduate study, it offers valuable academic and practical preparation for various forms of ministry, such as, youth ministry, social outreach, and other forms of parish and pastoral work. The College will award the Certificate to students who successfully complete all program requirements as well as the requirements for graduation. Typically, all requirements for the major and the certificate program can be completed in a normal four-year course of study. The Certificate Program is open to students from all majors. The College Chaplain serves as the Director of the Certificate Program. Students work with the Director and with their faculty advisor to select appropriate courses and coordinate the requirements of the Certificate Program in relation to their other academic requirements. The internship component of the Program is arranged in consultation with the Director. Students interested in pursuing ministry in a non-Christian religious tradition will consult with the Director to identify appropriate course substitutions. Ministry and Church Leadership Certificate Requirements: Students are required to complete the following five components: Certificate-Related Course Requirements PHR 235 Group Facilitation 3 REL 228 Introduction to Christian Theology 3 An additional course in Biblical Studies: REL 130 Hebrew Bible World and Culture 3 Or REL 140 The New Testament World and Culture 3 One additional course outside of the student’s major Undergraduate Degree Requirements| 73 selected from the following: (3 Credit Hours): BUS 201 Principles of Management 3 PSY 211 Child Development 3 PSY 218 Adolescent Development 3 PSY 222 Adult Development and Aging 3 PSY 333 Theories and Techniques in Counseling 3 SOC 215 Sociology of Marriage and Family 3 SOC 315 Social Inequality 3 REL 211 The American Religious Experience 3 REL 212 World Religions 3 REL 325 Sociology of Religion 3 And a supervised and reflective internship in a church/ministry setting - Students will engage in a semester-long supervised internship experience in a local/selected church context. In addition to working with a supervisor in the selected setting, the student will also meet regularly with the Director to engage in reflection and discussion about the nature and various dimensions of ministry. The internship will usually take place in the student’s junior or senior year. Depending on a student’s major, this internship may or may not be taken for credit. Certified Nonprofit Professional (CNP) Certificate Dr. Sharon May, Coordinator The Certified Nonprofit Professional (CNP) Certificate Program is a partnership between Maryville College and Nonprofit Leadership Alliance (NLA). The Nonprofit Leadership Alliance is a national organization that provides the Certified Nonprofit Professional (CNP) credential to students who complete the set of program requirements in addition to the requirements for their chosen major. The credential may be pursued by students in any major and is designed to prepare students to become skilled professionals and leaders in nonprofit organizations. Typically, all requirements for the major and the credential can be accomplished as a part of a student’s overall course of study and should not normally add to the time required to graduate. The CNP is widely recognized and accepted by nonprofit organizations around the world and is a valuable credential for students interested in working in the nonprofit sector. The credential is recognized as evidence of outstanding preparation for entry-level professional positions by many local, regional, and national nonprofit organizations. Growth in the demand for professional management and leadership by nonprofit organizations is expected to continue. Students work in partnership with the coordinator of the program, the Center for Community Engagement, and their academic advisors to establish individualized curricular and co-curricular programs that fulfill the requirements for the credential. Students also participate in a student association related to the program. The coordinator of the program and Center for Community Engagement staff provide assistance and guidance to the student association, coordinate internships, and assist students in finding post-graduate employment. Credential Requirements The CNP credential is awarded to students who fulfill a prescribed set of requirements developed by the Nonprofit Leadership Alliance. Through successful completion of each of these requirements, students will gain essential competencies for the nonprofit sector. Specific Requirements 1. Coursework: SLS 203: Introduction to Nonprofit Management (3 hrs.) BUS 201: Principles of Management (3 hrs.) 2. CNP Competency Knowledge Exam: Must pass national exam with a score of 76% or better.

Bachelor’s Degree Undergraduate Programs of Study The College’s major and minor programs and subject listings are described on the following pages. Please refer to the Credit Hours (p. 50) section of the Catalog for information about the amount and level of academic credit awarded for courses. Close attention should be given to all prerequisites. Some courses are offered in alternate years; others are offered only as demand warrants. The College reserves the right to withdraw or reschedule any course when the number of qualified enrollees is insufficient or when a qualified faculty member is unavailable in a given term. If there is sufficient demand for additional courses, they may be offered. A detailed Schedule of Courses booklet is published annually and posted on the website and the Tartan. The Maryville Curriculum, General Education Professor William Swann, Chair, Core Curriculum The Maryville Curriculum, a core program of general education, is based on the conviction that liberal learning is the best preparation for a satisfying and successful life, whatever one’s vocation. While many aspects of the college experience, including major-field requirements, allow students to prepare for a variety of careers and professions, general education emphasizes the cultivation of the intellectual skills and personal qualities that mark the educated person. Through the enhancement of skills and knowledge, the deepening of sensitivities, and the clarification of personal purpose, students learn to deal responsibly in a world of uncertainty and accelerating change. General education is the centerpiece of any liberal arts degree and provides curricular definition to the mission of a liberal arts college. The Maryville Curriculum follows directly and consciously from the College’s Statement of Purpose and Educational Goals. The Maryville Curriculum, often called the “core” curriculum, consists of 51 credit hours. Some general education requirements are met by virtue of the student’s major; others may be met by demonstration of competence. Course Descriptions for courses in the Maryville Curriculum are described in the Course Listings (p. 167) section of this Catalog. Distinctive features of the Maryville Curriculum: • Course groupings that are closely aligned with specified educational goals of the College. • An integrated and sequenced set of foundational courses designed to assist in adjustment to college life, to attend to the developmental and learning issues unique to first year students, and to develop the basic communication, quantitative, and critical thinking skills needed for success in college. • A range of coursework that provides grounding in the various modes of inquiry and all aspects of the liberal arts. • A range of choices for students among courses that fulfill common curricular goals. • Required groupings of courses designed to extend the college learning experience beyond the major and provide integration of liberal learning using various modes of inquiry. • Recognition that knowledge in certain domains is fulfilled by courses within the major. Undergraduate Degree Requirements| 75 • A strong global and cross-cultural dimension. • Attention to values and ethical decision-making throughout the curriculum, with a capstone course focusing on these matters. • A curricular structure built upon groups of courses focusing on shared student learning outcomes that result in a broad liberal arts experience. General Education Requirements Requirements in General Education are based on the four overarching educational goals of Maryville College. Each student must satisfy requirements for courses in each of the following instructional categories. Courses within domains share common student learning outcomes that guide teaching and learning within the group of courses.

American Sign Language-English Interpreting Professor Crystal Colter, Chair, Division of Behavioral Sciences Associate Professor William White, Coordinator The Major in American Sign Language-English Interpreting prepares students to work as professional interpreters and transliterators with Deaf and with hard-of- hearing persons in a variety of situations. While American Sign Language serves as a foundation, several other modes of communication used by the Deaf community are introduced as well. Audio-visual materials are accessible for individual study of a broad cross-section of communication methods. Interactions with Deaf and hard- of-hearing persons and regular practice using video equipment are principal means for the development of skills. The curriculum prepares students to interpret between spoken English and American Sign Language and to transliterate between conceptually accurate signed English and spoken English. Success in American Sign Language (ASL) and Deaf Studies or American Sign Language- English Interpreting requires being able to perceive signers’ faces, hand movements and body movements and being able to convey and receive ASL through these channels quickly at the natural pace of language. Also essential are ability to perceive and process visual information and eye-hand coordination that allow effective communication. A good foundation in basic ASL is critical to advancing successfully in the ASL and Deaf Studies major as well as the American Sign Language-English Interpreting major. American Sign Language-English Interpreting majors require good auditory perceptual skills as well as good visual skills when working between auditory and signed communications quickly and in real time. One exception is that Deaf people who want to become Deaf interpreters are encouraged to apply to the American Sign Language- English Interpreting program. Such interpreters are often intermediary interpreters who work between signed communications. The major goal of the program is to prepare graduates for entry-level professional interpretation and transliteration assignments between ASL and spoken English, contact varieties, and English-influenced sign forms and Spoken English, respectively. Students successfully completing the program of study will have achieved the following learning outcomes: 1. Students will perform entry-level interpreting work in a variety of contexts through a practicum experience. 2. Students will demonstrate knowledge of types of settings, language styles, and factors that impact communication. 3. Students will demonstrate knowledge about the history of interpreting, theoretical frameworks, and current trends on a standardized exam. 4. Students will determine their role in essential communities, provide a skills profile, develop a self- care plan, and discuss their philosophy of interpreting. 5. Students will demonstrate preparedness for professional aspects, identify ways to continue professional growth, and demonstrate knowledge and application of the RID Code of Professional Conduct. 6. Students will know the history, identities, and linguistic and interpreting issues of the deaf community. 7. Students will demonstrate expressive and receptive ASL skills at a conversational level on a proficiency assessment and internship experience. ASL/EI, B.A. The Major in American Sign Language-English Interpreting requires 56 hours beyond elementary American Sign Language (ASL 110: American Sign Language I and ASL 120: American Sign Language II).

Program Coordinator Our Mission We foster professional educators to intentionally impact individuals, groups, and communities of the world. Program Overview The Division of Education at Maryville College has a long and proud tradition of preparing educators who demonstrate and promote excellence in teaching and learning, within the context of a liberal arts institution. The Division of Education houses the Master of Arts in Teaching Secondary STEM and the Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education. Education faculty collaborate with multiple divisions to provide initial licensure in ten P/K-12 and 6-12 content areas. The Educator Preparation Program at Maryville College is continually refined to meet the State of Tennessee’s licensure requirements for teachers. As a result, modifications in programs and curriculum may occur. Those interested in becoming a teacher should meet with an advisor in the Educator Preparation Program as soon as possible. Secondary and P/K-12 licensure candidates are co-advised by an advisor in the Educator Preparation Program. Students are encouraged to discuss the educator preparation program and teacher licensure requirements with their advisors on a regular basis since the Tennessee State Board of Education may act on teacher licensure matters not addressed in the Catalog. Educator Preparation Professional Characteristics It is the responsibility of all students seeking teacher licensure to develop and maintain professional behaviors, characteristics, and dispositions that are associated with professional educators. These essential dispositions include self-regulation, grooming/appearance, relationships, professionalism, cultural awareness, integrity, affect, respect, communication, and reflection. Candidates are expected to demonstrate essential dispositions throughout the program of study not only in coursework, teaching practice, professional activities, and student teaching, but also in personal interactions with students, families, colleagues, and communities. In addition to the above, the Tennessee State Board of Education requires candidates to be aware of the Tennessee Teacher Code of Ethics that outlines behaviors that will result in the dismissal and revocation of the teaching license. Testing Requirement The Tennessee State Board of Education requires all students entering an educator preparation program to successfully pass at least one of three tests: –ACT score of at least 21 –SAT score of at least 1080 –Praxis Core (reading-156; writing-162; mathematics-150) Students should plan to take one of these three tests no later than the conclusion of the freshman year. There is a fee associated with each test that must be paid by the student. See the Administrative Assistant in the Education Division for information about testing. Screening Students enrolled in an undergraduate program leading to initial teacher licensure must meet specific requirements to enter and progress through the Educator Preparation Program. Educator preparation candidacy is determined at two points within the curriculum: (1) Level I Screening (sophomore year) and (2) Level II Screening (junior year). The progression for each level is explained below: Students enrolled in Elementary Education (K-5): Level I Screening – Initial entry into the Educator Preparation Program (Provisional Status) Level I screening is held spring of the sophomore year.

Engineering B.A./B.S.: Senior Year in Absentia Professor Maria Siopsis, Coordinator Maryville College cooperates with several universities to enable a student to combine extensive preparation in the liberal arts with professional training in engineering. This arrangement allows the student to earn two degrees, one from Maryville College and one from the engineering school. The first three years are spent at Maryville, completing Maryville College’s general education requirements and the courses necessary for further study in engineering or applied science; the remaining time, normally two years, is spent at an accredited school of engineering. Maryville College has formal dual-degree arrangements with Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, Tennessee, the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. Maryville College will honor the dual-degree arrangement with other regionally accredited institutions if the student is able to make transfer arrangements. After approximately four years of study, which include 92 semester hours from Maryville College and 28 semester hours (with grades of “C” or better) from the engineering school, the student will receive the Bachelor of Arts degree from the College. When all requirements for the engineering degree have been met, usually by the end of the fifth year of study, the engineering school will award the Bachelor of Science degree in the area of specialization. The second degree may be earned in over a dozen engineering fields, as well as in the applied sciences, depending on the university that the student attends. Maryville students enroll in the engineering school as transfer students. The College’s Dual-Degree program coordinator assists the students in both selecting an engineering school and in the transfer process. The decision to admit rests with the cooperating university, not with Maryville College. Admission to some engineering fields is very competitive, reflecting high demand for places in an entering class. Students successfully completing the program of study will have achieved the following learning outcomes: 1. Communicate mathematical ideas with precision and clarity in both written and oral form. 2. Develop expertise in appropriate technology for desired career path. 3. Understand and apply mathematical concepts in both theoretical and applied areas. 4. Model real-world problems, abstract real-world problems into the appropriate math world, solve problems mathematically, translate the math answers into real-world terms, and evaluate the correctness and validity of the answers. 5. Experience the application of mathematics to other disciplines through appropriate related courses. Any student interested in pursuing the dual-degree option is urged to consult the Dual-Degree Coordinator in the Division of Mathematics and Computer Science as early in the first year as possible. The program is highly structured, and most of the courses are part of a sequence. For that reason, the course of study must be carefully planned to ensure that all general education and major requirements are met during the three years spent at Maryville.

Mathematics is even more vital to liberal education today, when every citizen must be equipped with the quantitative skills needed to navigate our technological and data-driven world. The increasing demand for well- trained professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields is well- documented, and all of these require knowledge of mathematics. The curriculum in mathematics develops a student’s ability to think analytically and construct logical arguments, building a foundation to support advanced study in mathematics, but also providing a gateway to the expansive, diverse career opportunities in the mathematical sciences. The program provides students a range of experiences in both abstract and applied mathematics, as well as in the partner disciplines of computer science and physics. Two distinct major programs are offered. The Major in Mathematics provides a broad curriculum for students planning careers which require mathematical skill and problem-solving ability. Students may enter graduate school programs in mathematics, statistics, or related disciplines, or pursue careers in a variety of fields such as actuarial science, biomathematics, operations research, teaching, or finance. Students successfully completing the program of study will have achieved the following learning outcomes: 1. Communicate mathematical ideas with precision and clarity in both written and oral form. 2. Develop expertise in appropriate technology for their desired career paths. 3. Understand and apply mathematical concepts in both theoretical and applied areas. 4. Use mathematics to model real-world problems by choosing appropriate mathematical tools, representing the problem abstractly, and obtaining and interpreting results. 5. Evaluate the correctness and validity of solutions. 6. Experience the application of mathematics to other disciplines through appropriate related courses.

Philosophy, which literally means the “love of wisdom,” lies at the heart of a liberal arts education because it asks students to question, explore, and pursue truth wherever it may lead. In philosophy, rigor, honesty, and humility are requisite to exploring questions about reality and truth, justice and morality, life and death, language and culture, society and politics, and God and the meaning of existence. Students who major or minor in philosophy learn to think and write critically and to read and analyze texts carefully. Such skills are excellent preparations for professions in law, politics, business, education, ministry, and medicine.

Nevertheless, the study of Spanish does not simply involve language acquisition vis-à-vis classroom instruction; the acquisition of a language requires intellectual engagement through the study of the various cultures and histories of the peoples 148| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 who claim Spanish as their native tongue. The members of the Spanish faculty are dedicated to facilitating the acquisition and understanding of this modern language in a practical fashion and in a variety of settings such as serving in an internship in the general community and, for students eligible to travel abroad, via a study abroad experience in a Spanish-speaking country. In addition, students of Spanish are expected to increase second language proficiency—oral, aural, and written—via exposure to and academic engagement with a variety of media be it literary, film, historical, or professional (journalism, business, etc.). These media challenge students to question their perception of the various Hispanic cultures and to engage in critical inquiry that leads to a wider understanding of the world. Given the international and domestic influence of Spanish and Hispanic cultures in all aspects of daily life, the Major in Spanish provides a holistic academic, cultural, and linguistic preparation that enables the student to compete in a professional market increasingly needful of bilingual employees. The Major is an ideal—and arguably necessary—complement to any professional pursuit that requires contact with native speakers of Spanish. Students successfully completing the program of study will have achieved the following learning outcomes: Knowledge 1. Knowledge of literary terminology and concepts. 2.

Founded in 1819 as the Southern and Western Theological Seminary, it was originally intended as a seminary. Quickly realizing that most students were unprepared for graduate study in theology, its founder, the Rev. Isaac Anderson, began to offer preparatory “literary” courses. In 1842, the charter from the state of Tennessee was granted for “Maryville College.” Following the disruption of the Civil War, the College reopened and moved to its present location. Through more than two hundred years, the College has withstood major wars, economic upheavals and changing social realities. By adapting to its shifting environments, the College has remained a strong and vibrant academic community respected for academic excellence and sincerity in implementing its purpose. Today, Maryville College is a nationally ranked institution known for educating students to be giving citizens and gifted leaders, inspiring them to study everything, so that they are prepared for anything – to address any problem, engage with any audience and launch successful careers right away.",

Students receive career preparation from their first day on campus to their last. The College’s more than 10,000 alumni are living life strong of mind and brave of heart and are prepared, in the words of our Presbyterian founder, to “do good on the largest possible scale.” Academic Calendar Academic Calendar A Church-Related College for the 21st Century Maryville College proudly claims its Presbyterian heritage; from the time the Rev. Isaac Anderson founded the college in 1819 to train ministers for the frontier of the United States until today, when we enjoy a rich diversity of students. While holding strongly to its Presbyterian connection, the College honors and welcomes students from all backgrounds and religious traditions. The practice of faith and learning at Maryville College connects scholarship, worship, and community, by giving each student a place to explore, a place to grow and a place to commit. The whole community is invited to worship at the Center for Campus Ministry each Tuesday at 1:15. Faith and Learning Statement Maryville College, related by voluntary covenant to the Presbyterian Church (USA), seeks to provide a quality liberal arts education that encourages the search for truth in all areas of life. The Presbyterian tradition, with its historical emphasis on educating both clergy and laity, provides the theological framework for such an institution of higher education. Reformed theology places all reality in relationship to God and thus finds all subject matters worthy of study, while acknowledging, in an attitude of humility, that all human answers are at best provisional. The church “Reformed and always reforming” encourages the sort of ongoing openness to revisiting the questions and revising the answers that a true liberal arts education invites. As a church-related liberal arts college, Maryville strives to provide a quality education by creating an environment that: • Fosters a welcoming and diverse community of belonging for all; • Provides students with the tools to critically engage College Information| 9 spiritual, philosophical, and ethical issues; • Embraces rigorous exploration of differing points of view both inside and outside the classroom; • Challenges all persons to work for justice, strive for peace, and care for creation; and • Offers opportunities for worship and engagement in a community of scholarship, respect, and integrity. Maryville College does not presume that all members of the community will share the institution’s Presbyterian or Christian convictions; instead, we recognize that the life of the College is enriched by each person present in our midst.",

Calculating Withdrawal Refunds When students register for courses, the College assumes full-year enrollment, provides facilities, and executes contracts to provide educational services for the entire year. Federally mandated refund calculations apply when students withdraw. When recipients of student financial aid withdraw, refunds must be returned to various financial aid programs as well as the individual student. Students who receive financial aid, and are subject to a refund, might not be eligible for a cash refund. At times, refunds may be reapplied to a loan, thus reducing student indebtedness. Upon withdrawal, any cash refunds due will be processed as quickly as possible, but requires a minimum of 14 days. Refunds are only calculated and based on charges for tuition, fees, room, and board. No refunds will be made to students unless they withdraw from all courses in which they are registered. Charges and financial aid for students who change from full-time to part-time status during the drop/add period at the beginning of the semester will be revised on that basis. Students may use the first week of the semester to finalize registered courses without incurring additional fees. No refund is given for students who change from full-time to part-time status after the first ten days of the semester. Students defined as part-time who withdraw after the drop/add period will receive refunds under the same policy as full-time students. For refund purposes, the date of withdrawal is the date that the withdrawal process is initiated, or College personnel are provided with notification of intent to withdraw. The withdrawal date for students who stop attending classes 18| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 without formally withdrawing is based on the last date of academic activity.

Return of Title IV Funds Calculation Return of Title IV funds occurs when a student receives federal funds and then officially drops, withdraws or ceases attendance, with or without notifying the school. The amount of unearned Title IV aid must be calculated. This is determined by multiplying the percentage of term (based on calendar days including weekends and holidays) by the Title IV aid received. All types of Federal Aid– including loans–are used in this calculation. College work- study funds which have been earned will not be included. If a student attended more than 60% of the term, no return of funds will be required. After the amount of Title IV aid to be returned is calculated, a determination of how much must be returned by the institution and how much must be returned by the student will be made. Any funds returned by the institution are credited in the order of loans, (Unsubsidized Direct, Subsidized Direct, PLUS) Pell Grant, FSEOG Grant and other Title IV aid. If the student has any loans (Direct and PLUS) which have been used in the calculation, this obligation will be due and payable by the terms of the promissory note.

Intellectual Property Introduction The faculty, staff, and Board of Directors at Maryville College encourage scholarship, creativity, and innovation that may result in the creation of intellectual property.",

      "text": "The purpose of this Intellectual Property Policy is to establish mutual understanding of ownership, rights, and responsibilities related to the development, production, dissemination, and sale of intellectual property created by full-time and part-time Maryville College faculty, staff, and students. Definition of Intellectual Property For the purpose of this policy, the term “intellectual property” includes, but is not limited to, works of authorship inclusive of all mediums of expression (related to copyrights) and inventions and discoveries (related to patents). Ownership of Intellectual Property In most circumstances, the faculty member, student or staff member who creates the intellectual property has sole and exclusive ownership rights related to its sale, transfer, or use. In the development of intellectual property, the author/creator is responsible for obtaining permission or authorization for any use of copyrighted material or trademark (including that of the College) that may be included within the work itself. Following AAUP guidelines, there are certain situations in which Maryville College may claim ownership of intellectual property created by faculty, students, or staff. These situations include: • Works that are “made for hire,” created as a specific requirement of employment, as an assigned job duty, or in completion of a course assignment. (Note that a work is not necessarily classified as “made for hire” on the basis of use of College resources, facilities, or materials that are traditionally and commonly available to faculty and other members of the College community). • Negotiated contracts in which the author/creator has transferred or specified, in writing, a portion of ownership to the College, and • “Joint works” as described in the Copyright Act, where the institution can be considered a co-author.” The College is entitled to joint ownership in situations where it has contributed specialized services and facilities to the production of the work that goes beyond what is traditionally provided to faculty members generally. College resources include but are not limited to: College funds, supplies, computer resources, learning resources, equipment, software, the College name, personal position or status within the College, course enrollment, and/or College personnel. Such arrangements for joint ownership should be agreed to in writing, in advance of the creation of the intellectual property, and are in full conformance with other provisions of this agreement. To avoid conflicts related to ownership of intellectual property, faculty, staff and students should be aware that intellectual property issues may arise as a result of their work and should meet with the appropriate Vice President to establish a mutually agreeable understanding of 24| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 ownership issues prior to its creation.",

      "text": "This understanding is to be set forth in writing and signed by all parties who may have reason to believe that they would have some rights of ownership. This agreement should clearly set out the specific ownership or co-ownership arrangements between the creator and the College and is to be signed by the appropriate Vice President. In situations where an external party provides support or sponsorship in the form of a grant, contract, or other agreement, ownership of the intellectual property should be clearly negotiated prior to initiating the work. In such cases, the College may be allocated some rights of ownership. Responsibility for exploring procedural rules and ownership guidelines of granting agencies or individuals lies with the person or persons who will be creating the intellectual property. In situations where the individual or granting agency does not address the ownership issue, the guidelines and rules set forth in this document will prevail. Copyrights, patents, and other documents and contracts related to ownership of intellectual property are filed in the Maryville College Business Office. Written agreements of individual arrangements made between faculty, students and or staff members who create intellectual property and the Vice President under whose direction the activity or intellectual property is associated are to be completed and filed in the office of the appropriate Vice President and in the Business Office. The College will be primarily responsible for oversight and protection of intellectual property that is jointly owned by the College and its faculty, staff or students. Use of Intellectual Property Much of the creative work at Maryville College that has the potential for being designated as intellectual property relates to material utilized by the College for educational and administrative purposes.

Distribution of Revenue The sole owner of intellectual property, whether faculty member, student, staff member, or the College, is entitled to any proceeds of the sale of the property and is entitled to distribute or expend funds associated with those proceeds at will. In situations where there are multiple creators or owners, proceeds are to be distributed in accordance with the allocations as negotiated by the parties at the inception of the project. Should conflict arise from situations where allocations are unclear, or were never negotiated, the allocation will be decided upon according to the dispute resolution process outlined below. Future Negotiations and Dispute Resolution Due to the changing nature of intellectual property rights, contracts, and policies within higher education, the College recognizes the need to create processes for review and renegotiation of the intellectual property policy as well as the need to designate a process whereby disputes related to intellectual property can be resolved. Because faculty members are most closely associated with activities that can result in creation of intellectual property, responsibility for intellectual property policy review and revision rests with the Academic Dean (or designee) in consultation with the Faculty Personnel Standards Committee. Disputes related to ownership of intellectual property are referred to the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee who, upon receipt of an appeal, will create an Ad Hoc Committee to hear the dispute and to render a decision. The composition of the Ad Hoc Committee will consist of three members of the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee chosen by vote of that committee and two staff members or administrators appointed by the President of the College. None of the three faculty members of the Ad Hoc Committee should be a member of the same academic division as any faculty member included in the dispute. In situations where there are claims of ownership that affect multiple academic divisions such that there are not three College Policies| 25 faculty from unrelated divisions elected to the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee, the Dean of the College will appoint the needed number of faculty members to serve on the Ad Hoc Committee. The Ad Hoc Committee will elect its own convener and recorder and will follow the hearing procedures for the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee as published in the Faculty Handbook. The committee will gather information, hear arguments, review materials, and may consult legal counsel. Ultimately it will make a decision regarding the rights, ownership, management, and other aspects associated with the intellectual property in dispute.",

Experiential learning begins with concrete experience, but it does not stop there. It also involves an important element of reflection, an effort to develop a clear view of what one is doing and to assess its value. These observations and reflections should lead learners to new generalizations and concepts, fresh understandings of the world and oneself, and some enhancement of ability. Subsequently, new learning should be tested and refined in a different situation or additional experiences. At its best, experiential learning deepens the learners’ sensitivity to social and physical surroundings and encourages them to use senses and wits more fully.

It is a kind of experience that students have not had before. 32| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 3. It requires students not only to do something new but to stand back from the activity, assess its significance, and draw conclusions about it. 4. It provides opportunities to test these conclusions (or in the case of a skill-oriented course, to demonstrate increased mastery.) 5.

Students must complete the registration for services and provide documentation which supports the request for reasonable accommodations for the disability. Registration form and documentation guidelines are located online at www.maryvillecollege.edu/disability. 34| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 3. Determination of Eligibility With guidance from the Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD), the Office of Disability Resources and Accessibility considers the following evidence for determining a student’s disability and the provision of specific accommodations: Student’s Self Report : The student is the most valuable resource for information regarding how the student may be impacted by their condition(s). The student’s experience of disability, barriers and effective accommodations is critical information. This information is gathered through the registration form and through meetings with Disability Resources & Accessibility staff. Observation and Interaction: In some cases, disability is apparent either in terms of presentation or effect. As part of the interactive process, Disability Resources & Accessibility staff may make appropriate and reasonable judgments that contribute toward the determination of disability. Documentation from External or Third Parties: Documentation from a qualified medical, psychological, or educational professional should provide information on the current impact/limitations of the condition in a postsecondary environment. 4. Accommodation Determination Students should contact the Disability Resources & Accessibility office and set-up an appointment to determine reasonable accommodations. The official registration and implementation of services cannot begin until the student meets with a Disability Resources & Accessibility staff member. Disability Resources & Accessibility professionals believe the student is the most valuable resource for determining effective and reasonable accommodations. Disability Resources & Accessibility assists students in becoming self-advocates while supporting their essential needs.",

Students who feel that they are experiencing problems/concerns in classes or the college setting should contact the office as soon as possible to resolve any difficulties they may be experiencing regarding accommodations or access on campus. Disability Resources & Accessibility will begin an interactive process with those individuals regarding the problems/concerns. Important Notes It is the student's responsibility to arrange for certain services that are outside the scope of Disability Resources & Accessibility and Maryville College. These services include, but may not be limited to, attendant care, mobility training, items/services of a personal nature, and sources of financial aid. Disability Resources & Accessibility professionals are available to consult with students regarding special needs and possible local resources. Letter of Accommodation When reasonable accommodations have been established, Disability Resources & Accessibility staff will create a Letter of Accommodation (LOA). The LOA indicates the academic accommodations which the student is qualified to receive. Students must grant permission each semester for the office to send the LOA to the student’s faculty. Students may choose which faculty the LOA is sent to. Students may ask for the letter to be sent to their advisor. Before issuing an LOA, Disability Resources & Accessibility must have a complete file. The file must include the registration form, appropriate documentation, and a signed Release of Information Waiver. Disability Resources & Accessibility staff will not discuss academic accommodation concerns with faculty members until all documents are received. Disability Resources & Accessibility will not disclose or discuss the disability documentation provided by the student without the written consent of the student. First Week of Class Responsibilities Students are encouraged to meet with each of their scheduled class professors during the first week of the term to discuss the LOA for the implementation of the accommodations. Students and faculty should contact Disability Resources & Accessibility with questions or concerns regarding ways to implement the qualifying accommodations. Continuing Enrollment Each semester, students should review their existing accommodations and request that their LOA be sent to their faculty. If additional accommodations are requested, Disability Resources & Accessibility will review current documentation and meet with the student to discuss the additional requested accommodations.

Education Abroad Mark Twain once wrote, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness – all foes to real understanding.” Recognizing the validity of that statement, Maryville College believes a period of travel and study outside the United States should be a part of one’s education whenever possible. Confronting other cultures and viewpoints, learning about the customs and practices in other societies, coping with unfamiliar surroundings in a language not fully one’s own can do much to deepen insights and broaden perspectives. Such experience can also foster remarkable personal growth. Education abroad programs are offered through the Center for Global Engagement. Detailed information about education abroad is found at https://www.maryvillecollege.edu/studyabroad or by meeting with an Education Abroad Advisor at the Center for Global Engagement in International House. Every Maryville College student has the opportunity to travel abroad during their academic program. Travel Study Programs Short-term possibilities come through experiential travel with a small group of students and faculty. In recent years, groups of students and faculty have used three-week class terms and spring break for study travel to locales in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America. Students may apply for financial assistance. 36| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 Semester and Academic Year Education Abroad Programs For more extended periods, Maryville College has partnered with other foreign institutions. Through such associations Maryville students can experience life and study on a university or college campus in many areas of the globe. Maryville College maintains bilateral exchange partnerships and International Student Exchange Program (ISEP) exchange programs in 50 countries to over 150 overseas institutions. Program stipulations vary, but in most cases exchange programs are included in Maryville College fees - regular tuition and fees, and usually room and board are paid to Maryville College. Under these reciprocal agreements, when a Maryville student studies at a related institution, a student from that institution may study at Maryville for an equal time period. Through ISEP, students also have access to ISEP-Direct semester or summer programs. These are affordable fee- paid programs in a number of countries that do not offer the option to do an exchange. The majority of programs offer instruction in English; however, many programs also offer language study or full-immersion study in another language. Summer Abroad Summer Abroad programs (3-6 credits on average) give students the opportunity to study in a foreign country for a short period, often focusing on intensive language study or one field of study or one aspect of a country or culture.",

Internships and Community Engagement Abroad Maryville College works with several international organizations to place students in internship abroad programs. These programs are generally between 6-10 weeks in length and are offered in locations around the world during the summer. Internships abroad are generally unpaid and are offered for academic credit. Students pay a program fee that covers placement, tuition, and housing costs. Planning, Eligibility and Application Process A period of study is possible at any time starting in spring break of the first year and the best time to study abroad during each student’s degree plan varies by major. Planning needs to start well in advance and is best done in close consultation with the academic advisor and the Center for Global Engagement. Approval for education abroad is required. Students apply to the Center for Global Engagement (CGE), must meet minimum G.P.A. standards, and must follow the application procedures set by the CGE. Students participating in semester, year abroad or summer study, internship or community engagement abroad programs are supported in the pre- departure phase by taking OVS 203 (p. 229): Cross Cultural Preparation for Education Abroad. Students also may choose to study at foreign institutions with which Maryville College does not have a relationship; however, different policies and practices may apply. Further, the College will scrutinize carefully, and may reject, credits earned at institutions overseas. The programs at institutions described in this catalog have been screened for academic quality and attention to the needs of students studying abroad. More information on programs can be found on the Maryville College education abroad website https://www.maryvillecollege.edu/studyabroad and through the Center for Global Engagement at International House.

Statement of Student Responsibility Each student is expected to be thoroughly familiar with the academic requirements of the College as stated in the Catalog. The responsibility for meeting all requirements for graduation rests entirely upon the student. Faculty advisors, academic division chairs, the Registrar, the Associate Dean, and the Vice President and Dean of the College welcome the opportunity to provide assistance, but the basic responsibility remains with the student personally. Academic Advising Every student has an academic advisor at all times. New first-year students work with the academic advising staff in the Advising Center in the summer before their first semester. Once classes start, the instructor in the First-Year Seminar (FYS 110) is the academic advisor for first-year students. When students declare a major, usually in February of the first year, advising shifts to a disciplinary faculty academic advisor who often remains the student’s advisor until graduation. Students who do not declare a major in February will be advised by staff in the Advising Center until a major is declared. New transfer students work with the academic advising staff in the Advising Center in the summer before their first semester.",

      "text": "Transfer students who are ready to declare a major when the semester starts shift to a disciplinary faculty academic advisor who often remains the student's advisor until graduation. Frequent contact between academic advisor and student is essential. Academic advisors initiate some contacts, but students are strongly encouraged to make every effort to maintain a close relationship with their advisors. Because students hold full responsibility for ensuring that specific disciplinary requirements for graduation are completed, frequent and careful review of the College Catalog in consultation with advisors is helpful. Academic Integrity Academic Integrity Policy Truth and justice should be hallmarks of the academic community. Academic study involves a search for truth through critical evaluation of previous academic work. Effective teaching requires that the teacher be able to see the materials with which a student starts and, on the basis of the student’s results, judge the quality of the student’s effort and thought. Academic honesty is thus essential to effective learning. Any compromise of these moral cornerstones prevents an academic community and all of its members from being true seekers of wisdom. It is therefore very important for all members of the community to understand clearly the standards that define this collective search for wisdom. As the Maryville College Covenant declares, it is important for all students \"to act with integrity in all interaction...to encourage and support...fellow students as they aspire to be honest in their academic endeavors.\" Violations of Academic Integrity Breaches of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Cheating—this includes copying, or claiming as one’s own, the work of another student with or without his or her knowledge, and with or without subsequent revision; and the use of any unauthorized notes, crib sheets, or other written or electronic aids in exams or quizzes. Cheating includes ghost writing, submitting under the name of one author written work that was done by another author. 2. Plagiarism—inadequately acknowledging intellectual debts, either intentionally or unintentionally, in written work. This includes failure to document facts, ideas, wording, or organization taken from a source. It includes what some people call “mosaic plagiarism” which involves paraphrasing too closely to the original wording, that is, providing documentation of the source but either not using quotation marks to indicate borrowing of the author’s wording, or altering the source’s wording but not its sentence structure. It also includes failure to acknowledge informal debts for helpful suggestions— acknowledgement such as professional Academic Procedures and Regulations 42| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 scholars often make in a footnote or a prefatory statement (e.g., “I am gratefully indebted to Rita Johnson for suggesting this overall direction of inquiry”).",

      "text": "The basic principle governing documentation is that anything— facts, ideas, wording, or organization—that is not common knowledge and is not original to the author should be documented. In doubtful cases, providing too much documentation is better than providing too little. 3. Unauthorized collaboration—any academic work on a specific assignment by more than one student without the prior approval of the instructor. Acceptable collaboration varies widely from professor to professor and from one assignment to another. Students must take responsibility to determine whether or not a collaborative effort is appropriate. 4. Fabrication—knowingly presenting false information in oral, written or artistic work, such as faked data in lab reports, falsified bibliographic citations, etc. It includes misrepresentation of academic records or credentials. 5. Unauthorized multiple submission—this includes simultaneous submission of the same piece of work in two courses without the prior approval of both instructors, as well as turning in any assignment for which one has already received credit, without the prior approval of the later instructor. The instructor receiving the later submission should have the opportunity to confer with the earlier instructor about the assignment and to determine whether the multiple submissions are appropriate. 6. Abuse of academic materials—destroying, losing, defacing or damaging intellectual resources that belong to someone else. Examples include defacing library materials; introducing viruses to college computers or erasing operational files from them; and abusing instructional tools, equipment, or materials. 7. Electronic dishonesty—this goes beyond plagiarism or fabrication from electronic sources. It includes inappropriate access to network files, accounts, or resources; knowingly spreading viruses; disabling computer hardware or software; software piracy; etc. 8. Unauthorized alteration or forgery of documents and records—this includes such things as forging an advisor’s signature or altering the information to which the signature is appended, altering an exam response and then requesting a review of the grade, or altering academic records. 9. Facilitation of academic dishonesty—knowingly helping someone else commit an act of academic dishonesty. This includes knowing of an instance of academic dishonesty and not disclosing it. 10. Failure to secure IRB and/or IACUC approval for human and animal research—research projects involving human participants and animal subjects are required by federal law to undergo review and approval by the Institutional Research Board (for human participants, including questionnaire surveys) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (for animal subjects). It is the responsibility of all members of the Maryville College community—students, faculty, staff, and administration—to familiarize themselves with the violations defined above.",

This includes a responsibility to help ensure that breaches of academic integrity do not remain undiscovered. Faculty must accept the unique responsibility that they have for clearly defining, in course syllabi and assignments, the parameters of legitimate collaboration and any other areas in which the boundaries of academic integrity may be unclear. The administration has a responsibility to assist in the fair and timely implementation of standards and sanctions. Procedure for Individual Incidents If a teacher has information leading to a reasonable opinion that there has been an incident of academic dishonesty, the following procedures shall be followed: 1. The teacher should confer with his or her academic division chair (or some other trusted colleague if the teacher is also the division chair); 2. If both agree that the evidence establishes with certainty that academic integrity standards have been violated and if they agree on the extent of the offense, the teacher may proceed to assign without further process a grade penalty on the assignment, a penalty proportioned to the severity of the offense and not exceeding a grade of zero on the assignment. The teacher will place on file in the Registrar's Office a letter of censure recording the offense along with relevant documentation. Such a letter will not become part of the student's permanent academic record, but will be available during the student's time at the Academic Procedures and Regulations| 43 college to any faculty member who may later inquire whether the student has previously been found guilty of academic dishonesty. Before assigning a penalty, the teacher should check to see whether any prior letter of censure exists. If there is one letter of censure already on file, action is at the discretion of the faculty member who may either assign penalty or refer the case to the Academic Integrity Board (AIB). If two letters are already on file, the teacher must refer the case to the AIB. At such time, the Registrar will initiate the preliminary procedures specified below. The teacher must discuss with the student the offense and the penalty, informing the student of his or her right to appeal the decision and the penalty to the AIB.

The teacher should inform the student of his or her right to appeal the sanction to the Academic Integrity Board. If the student does not admit guilt, the teacher may drop the matter or may refer the case to the AIB.

Academic Integrity Board Purpose and Jurisdiction The Academic Integrity Board (AIB) investigates and adjudicates cases of alleged academic dishonesty involving college courses or library use. Membership The Board will be composed of three faculty members and two students, and is to be constituted early in the fall term each year. The Vice President and Dean of the College will call an organizational meeting. The faculty members will be those who have completed a term on the Academic Life Council (ALC) in the previous two years. If there are four such persons, three will be selected by lot and the fourth will serve as an alternate who will replace a faculty member who is unable to serve on a particular case. If an additional alternate is needed, priority will be given to the current ALC member representing the same constituency as the person to be replaced. If that person cannot serve, or is otherwise disqualified, another faculty member of ALC will be selected by lot. The student members will be the two students with the longest service on ALC.",

Adding a course as an audit or changing enrollment from credit to audit must take place within the first week of the semester and permission of the instructor is necessary. The audit does not count toward graduation requirements, but does appear on the permanent academic record if attendance is satisfactory. Students should note that credit by examination cannot be earned for courses that have been taken as an audit at Maryville College. Catalog-Year-Determination A Catalog Year is the academic year (usually Fall to Summer) when a student first enrolls full-time as a degree- seeking student at the College. The Catalog Year dictates which specific degree requirements a student needs to complete their degree. A student is normally expected to satisfy the graduation requirements published in the Catalog in the academic year of their initial matriculation, provided there are no breaks in continuous enrollment. During their time as degree-seeking students at Maryville College, students may elect to adopt a more recent Catalog, subject to the following restrictions: 1. Students must use a single Catalog for all graduation requirements. Mixing Catalogs is not allowed. 2.",

      "text": "Students may not choose a Catalog Year prior to their matriculation. 3. Students must notify the Registrar's Office before the start of the semester if they want to change their Catalog Year. Procedures for changing the Catalog Year can be found on the Registrar's website. 4. Students who add or change a major(s), minor(s), or certificate(s) will retain the original Catalog Year unless they notify the Registrar's Office that they plan to change to a newer Catalog Year. 5. When the College updates graduation requirements, students may choose to adopt a newer Catalog Year, but are not required to do so if the changes would delay graduation. Academic departments will ensure that a reasonable path to graduation remains available under the student's original Catalog Year. 6. If students change their Catalog Year, they may not move back to an older Catalog Year. A student's Catalog Year remains active as long as there is no interruption in Enrollment. Otherwise, a Catalog is active for 6 years. Students seeking readmission to the College should consult the Catalog Year language on the Readmission page (p. 13). Class Attendance Regular attendance at classes is expected of all students, though each instructor is free to set whatever attendance requirements for an individual course are deemed suitable. These requirements are printed in the course syllabus. Students should pay close attention to the attendance policy for each of their classes. Refer to Administrative Withdrawal section in this catalog. The College recognizes as legitimate reasons for occasional absence such difficulties as illness, accident, family grief, or pressing personal responsibility. If absences for these or other reasons are excessive in terms of the stated attendance policy for the class, the student should explain the problem to the instructor, or the instructor may initiate such a discussion. If excessive absences persist, the student may be assigned a grade of “F” for the course. Occasionally students who represent the College in off- campus activities find it necessary to miss classes. The number of such absences, however, may not exceed 10% of the class meetings without the permission of the instructor. Students should notify the professor in advance to reschedule course work where necessary. Class Schedule During the regular semester, most classes are scheduled Monday through Friday in Monday- Wednesday-Friday and Tuesday-Thursday formats. Evening courses normally meet one or two evenings each week. Some courses, many of them four credit hour courses, meet more often and may include laboratory periods. May term classes usually meet for three hours Monday through Friday during the three- week session. Summer classes meet on a varied schedule during the three-week session, a five-week session, or the full 11-week session.

They have fewer than 12 credit hours remaining to complete their degree. 2. They submit a Degree Completion Plan, approved by their academic advisor, outlining how and when the remaining requirements will be fulfilled. 3.

Degrees will be officially conferred upon completion of all requirements in May, August, or December. Students may participate in commencement exercises only once, during the academic year in which they complete their degree requirements or are approved to participate early under this policy. Course Load To complete a degree in four years, students must earn an average of 30 credits each year. Programs of study requiring more than the minimum 120 hours require higher semester course loads to complete the degree within four years. No more than four credit hours may be taken in any one of the three-week periods. A course load of 12 hours is required for full-time status and the maximum load is 18 hours in a semester. Within the semester, overload charges will be assessed for each credit hour over 18 (See the section Admissions and Financial Aid (p. 10) in this Catalog).

Grade Disagreements In the event a student and a professor disagree about the quality of the student’s academic work and the final course grade, the disagreement should be resolved in discussion between the parties involved. If this discussion does not resolve the matter, the student may appeal to the Academic Division Chair. If no agreement is reached as a result of this effort, either of the disputers may request the Associate Dean to act as mediator. The mediator may aid decision making, but may not arbitrate. As a last step, a request may be filed with the Associate Academic Dean for the formation of a committee composed of the Associate Dean, two other faculty members, and two students acceptable to both parties involved in the grade dispute. This committee will initially mediate with the authority to arbitrate. The majority decision of the committee is final. Grades are not open for dispute more than one year after the end of the term in which the grade is assigned. Grade Point Average (GPA) The grade point average (GPA) for a semester is computed by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the number of credit hours for which quality points are earned during the semester. The cumulative GPA is based on all quality points earned and all credit hours for which quality points are earned at Maryville College. A course may be repeated once to replace a previous grade. A second course repeat may replace a grade only with permission of the Dean or Associate Dean of the College. Course grades earned in repeated attempts beyond these limits may not replace previously earned grades and the grade earned in each repeat is included in the GPA calculation.

W Withdrew - Given when a course is dropped during the first 45 days of classes. This grade does not affect grade point average. Graduation Honors To qualify for graduation with honors, a student must have completed at least 60 hours at Maryville College. The cumulative grade point average determines the level of honors. The three levels of honors and the minimum grade point averages required are: Summa cum laude: 3.95 Magna cum laude: 3.75 Cum laude: 3.50 Graduation honors are based on grades earned at the time of graduation and are not recalculated as a result of any coursework completed after graduation.

Permission to enter a course after five class meetings is given only in rare circumstances. Leave of Absence LEAVE OF ABSENCE REGISTRATION AND REINSTATEMENT Students who wish to leave the College temporarily (excluding summers) for academic, medical, religious, or military service-related reasons may request a Leave of Absence for a specific period of time. Leave of absence is meant for students who plan to complete a Maryville College degree but who have a need to be away from their Maryville College studies for an extended period. Leave of Absence is distinct from both withdrawal from the College and suspension from it. Typically, it is arranged in advance of the semester for which it is granted. It is usually not granted for a semester once that semester is underway, although it may be granted for the following semester. Some situations (e.g., those created by military deployment or health-related reasons) may call for leaves granted during a relevant semester. 54| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 Leaves are usually approved for one semester and may be extended to one year with approval of the Committee on Academic Standing. An exception to this general rule is made for leaves granted so that students may complete the second part of a dual degree program at other partner institutions, in which case the standard leave time is two years. In most cases, a Leave of Absence may not exceed a cumulative total of two years. Leave of Absence may not end during a semester that is in progress. Applications for Leave of Absence must be submitted to the Registrar. Leaves of Absence must be requested at least three weeks before the beginning of the term during which the student wants to be absent from the College. Requests for unexpected leaves must be made as soon as possible and are not considered or approved retroactively. Students who do not return after the specific term of the Leave of Absence will be withdrawn retroactive to their leave date and may face financial consequences. Leaves of more than 180 days may also have financial consequences. Students in multiple majors may not request a leave of absence status from only one program. International students should also contact the Center for Global Engagement to discuss eligibility and potential visa issues. As noted above, the College recognizes four kinds of leave of absence: academic, medical, religious, and military: A. Application for a leave of absence for academic reasons is granted only for the purpose of academic enrichment.",

The student’s academic advisor must certify that the student has completed all Maryville College-specific requirements of the dual degree program and is ready to move on to the second part of the dual degree program. In the case of academically motivated leaves taken for reasons other than the completion of a dual degree program, students taking courses elsewhere while on Leave of Absence must obtain division approval in advance for any course to be used as transfer credit for degree completion. Students and advisors should bear in mind that there are rules governing the minimum number of hours which must be completed at the College for a Maryville College degree, and certain requirements which must be satisfied on campus. Study abroad under the auspices of Maryville College is managed through Overseas Study registration and is not addressed by this policy. A student taking Leave of Absence registration in order to complete a dual degree program has the option to participate in Commencement, ordinarily at the point at which the student completes the minimum number of hours for a Maryville College degree. The actual degree will not be awarded until the official transcript has been received from the partner institution and the required transfer credit has been awarded. Students taking academic Leave of Absence from the College in order to complete the non-Maryville College portion of a dual degree program may choose to live in College residence halls, depending on the availability of space, in accordance with Maryville College rules and the College’s schedule. Accordingly, they would also participate in a College meal plan. Normal room and board fees will apply, and the needs of enrolled students will take precedence in the allotment of rooms. Students taking academic Leave of Absence for dual degree programs may also continue to use other facilities and services normally available to registered students, such as health services, the post office, email and printing accounts, sports passes, etc., to participate in College-sponsored events open to all College students, and (where consistent with the requirements of dual degree partners) participate in College-sponsored student activities such as ensembles and team sports. The College will decide upon suitable student fees to support these activities on a yearly basis. The use of College rooms, facilities, and/or services and participation in College-sponsored student activities are not allowed to students on Leave of Absence for any reason other than the completion of dual degree programs.

Medical withdrawal is better suited to students who encounter unexpected health problems that make it impossible for them to continue their studies or impossible to finish a semester. C. Application for Leave of Absence for religious reasons is suitable for religious obligations that are of an extended character and that would make it impossible for a student to succeed during a semester.

Students returning from an approved Leave of Absence are not required to apply for readmission but instead need only submit a “return to campus” notification to the Registrar’s Office by April 1 for a Fall Semester return or November 1 for the following Spring Semester. Reinstatement is never guaranteed or automatic. The College reserves the right to require additional documentation that the student is qualified and ready to return. Decisions regarding financial aid are made separately from the reinstatement process. See Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence (ETLOA) (p. 55) for policy and procedures for granting a brief absence during the semester.

Each request will be reviewed on an individualized basis and may require appropriate documentation to support the request. Additional time may be granted, when medically indicated. Requests for an emergency temporary leave of absence will be reviewed and approved by the Vice President & Dean of Students and communicated to the Assistant Academic Dean for a specified period of time. An emergency temporary leave of absence may be applicable for students who must be absent for mental and/or physical health reasons, or any other personal or family emergency. Failure to attend classes by the return date specified on the emergency temporary leave of absence form may result in an administrative withdrawal from the College.

When feasible, students should seek approval of the emergency temporary leave of absence prior to the start of the absence. However, the College is aware that extenuating circumstances may exist in emergency situations where such prior approval is not feasible. Major and Minor Declaration Deadlines All matriculated students must declare a major before completing 60 credits towards graduation. Transfer students entering with 60 credits or more must declare their major by the 10th day of classes in their first semester. The following procedures apply for students who are listed as undeclared, have earned 48 credits towards graduation, and are enrolled for a subsequent term. • A student who has earned 48 credits towards graduation and is enrolled for additional credits will be notified by email from the Registrar’s Office of the requirement to declare a major before registering for more than 60 credits. The student will also be informed that a registration hold will be placed on their account if they fail to comply. • If a major has not been declared by the time a student attempts to register for beyond 60 credits, a registration hold will prevent registration beyond 60 credits. • A student must submit the Major/Minor Declaration form to the Office of the Registrar with the signature of the appropriate Division Chair for the major being declared. Once processed, the hold flag will be removed from student’s account and the student will be eligible for registration. Requests to change the major and/or minor will be accepted by the Registrar’s Office at any time, but requests submitted after the drop/add period closes for the current semester will not be effective until the beginning of the next semester. The deadline to make a final change of major prior to graduation is March 1 for May commencement of the 56| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 following year, April 1 for Summer term graduation of the following year, and October 1 for December graduation of the following year. The final deadline to declare a minor is the 3rd week of the penultimate semester before graduation. After these dates, applications may be approved on a case by case basis by the Assistant Dean for Academic Success and may require mandatory financial aid counseling. Applications are available from the Registrar’s page on the Tartan. Students missing the deadline may appeal to the Registrar.

Non-Traditional Modes of Learning No more than 32 credit hours may be counted toward graduation requirements for any combination of credit by examination, internships, military coursework, or online courses. Credit for courses offered through non-traditional modes of learning will be granted only for courses offered by accredited institutions and, before credit is granted, each course will be evaluated to ensure it meets requirements of Maryville College course work. Probation and Suspension It is the responsibility of individual students to maintain good academic standing and to make normal progress toward a degree. The record of each student is regularly reviewed by the Registrar. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.00 are placed on academic probation. To continue enrollment in probationary status, students must show steady improvement in academic performance. Full-time, first-year-in-college students who are placed on academic probation following the first fall semester must successfully complete a Maryville College Life Enrichment Program Portfolio Project in self-management through the Academic Support Center during the first spring semester. Students who fail to complete the project successfully are subject to suspension from the College. At the end of each term careful consideration is given to the record of each student. Students who fall below minimum standards for credit hours and cumulative grade point average are not considered to be making normal progress toward a degree and are subject to suspension from the College or to a change from degree candidacy to special student status. These minimum standards are listed below. Following a suspension, students may apply for readmission after at least a semester of satisfactory academic work at another institution or successful work experience. Students placed in special student status by action of the College may continue enrollment and, when the cumulative GPA is raised to at least 2.00, petition for readmission to degree candidacy. A decision to suspend may be appealed to the College’s Committee on Academic Standing. In such an appeal, the obligation rests with the student to explain the special considerations that support continued enrollment.

Progress Reports – Three Week and Mid-Semester Progress reports are completed twice each semester. During the third week of the semester, the Academic Support Center staff requests faculty of all 100-level courses to submit a progress report for any student who is having academic difficulty. At mid-semester, faculty submit a progress grade for all students to the Registrar. Academic Procedures and Regulations| 57 All three-week progress reports and mid - semester progress grades are shared with students’ faculty advisor and other appropriate College staff. These reports are used to inform and counsel students and are not recorded on the official transcript. Students are expected to stay current in each course and to contact their professor if they have questions about their progress. Furthermore, students should not view a mid-semester progress grade as an implied final grade. Although early course success is often associated with a positive final grade, students should keep in mind that the majority of course assignments are typically completed and graded after the mid-semester reporting period. Specialized and Individualized Programs of Instruction Maryville College offers many opportunities for students to tailor their learning experiences to their own needs and interests. The regulations governing these opportunities are set out below. Honors Study Honors study at Maryville College may be pursued in three ways. Participation in any honors program is reserved for those students with a cumulative grade point average of 3.25 or higher and who have attained sophomore standing. However, first year Presidential and Dean’s scholars enroll in Honors Tutorial Training. Honors work is voluntary, except for Presidential Scholars and Dean’s Scholars, who are required to participate in a prescribed number of honors activities. Honors study is distinct from and in no way related to honors designations for graduating seniors (cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Honors study is noted on College transcripts. Honors Seminars are offered occasionally by members of the Maryville College faculty. Honors seminars may be special sections of regular course offerings, or they may cover topics not regularly a part of the College curriculum. Honors seminars may be electives, major courses (if approved by the academic division chair), or general education courses (if approved by the Chair of the Core Curriculum). Honors seminars are listed in the Schedule of Courses with enrollment normally limited to 15 students. Honors Study within Existing Courses permits students of superior ability to pursue honors study in courses in which they are registered.",

For successful completion of honors study in an existing course, students receive one additional credit hour beyond the regular credit allotment for the course. Arrangements for honors study are negotiated with the course instructor and require the approval of the relevant academic division chair(s). The arrangements must be reported to the Registrar no later than the first week of the course. Honors Tutorial Practica are programs of tutoring and/or other appropriate academic work with faculty under the coordination of the Academic Support Center staff. Each practicum in this special program is awarded one credit hour and the course may be repeated to a maximum of four credit hours. With the permission of the instructor, the practicum may be taken on a non- credit basis. Satisfactory completion of Honors Tutorial Training is a prerequisite to all Honors Tutorial Practica. Individualized Majors Students pursuing a B.A. degree may design a Major. A formal application and approval of the Committee on Individualized Instruction are required. Individualized majors must include: One primary subject area 18 credit hours Related subject area 12 credit hours Senior Study 3-6 credit hours A faculty sponsor in each subject area is required. Applications are available in the Registrar’s Office. Maryville College also offers a separate Interdisciplinary Major, with requirements listed in the Interdisciplinary Major section of the Catalog. Individualized Study Courses Students who wish to pursue a topic in their major that is not available through a regular catalog course may request a program of individualized reading or experimental work. The academic division chair will consider requests on the basis of the appropriateness of the topic and availability of faculty for supervision. Such a course may be an additional course in the major or, when appropriate, may substitute for a major course. Such coursework carries a 350 number and students may not earn more than three credit hours through individualized study courses. Students must have at least junior standing. Such a program is pursued under the guidance of a faculty member, who confers regularly 58| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 with the student and assesses the program. Approval by the academic division chair is required, and an additional fee of $50 per credit hour is charged.

All academic divisions are required to follow guidelines as published in this Catalog and divisional guidelines that more specifically define the experiences. In order to make the most of these experiences, students receive mentoring and preparation that supports positive outcomes for both students and internship sites. The mentoring and preparatory process is provided by the faculty advisor/internship coordinator in some majors and in other majors is provided Career Center staff. Students and supervisors must follow procedures related to application and approval of the experience, the range of accepted experiences, methods of reporting and verifying experiences, and the duties of the faculty supervisor and the internship site supervisor.

Summer internships for zero credit hours are available to students who are using the experience in fulfilling their Maryville College Works significant practical experience (SPE) requirement. Although students are required to register for them, there is no tuition required. Students must register for the internship courses prior to the internship experience and the activity must take place in the term for which the students are registered for them. Internship experiences (courses numbered 337) are allotted 0 to 15 credit hours and are intended to give students significant practical experiences in a work, service, or research setting. Credit earned for internships is allocated in proportion to the scope and duration of the experience. Divisional guidelines for internships vary, but for each credit hour granted, students are expected to be involved in at least 45 hours of approved activity. Approved activity may include time spent at the internship site, as well as structured goal setting, reflective assignments, and meetings with the designated on-campus supervisor.

Life Enrichment Program The Maryville College Life Enrichment Program (MCLEP or “portfolio”) is a means to enrich and diversify students’ educational experience through a combination of curricular and co- curricular activities. In the program students work closely with a faculty or staff mentor to identify or design projects appropriate for their personal growth. Through completion of an individually designed project, students earn one credit hour. The projects must fall into one of the following categories: • wellness • leadership • creative/aesthetic works • cross-cultural experience, or • citizenship (e.g., service and community involvement) Expected outcomes include some of the following: an enriched life, an integration of experiences, discovery, deeper development, and transformation. A central feature of each project is the maintenance of a personal journal, the purposes of which are to encourage careful observation and reflection and to deepen knowledge of oneself. Ordinarily, only one credit hour may be earned in any category, and no more than three credit hours may be earned in the program. One project may be taken for credit in a semester. The program is available only during the fall and spring semesters, except for portfolios related to cross- cultural experience with permission of the International 60| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 Programming Committee. Under certain circumstances and conditions, it is possible to earn more than one education abroad-related portfolio credit in a cross-cultural experience. These circumstances include credit for an embedded education abroad program or a cross-cultural project that takes place during any academic session that students study abroad. Contact Kirsten Sheppard at 865-273-8991. A special portfolio project in self-management is required of first year-in-college students placed on academic probation following the first fall semester (See section on Probation and Suspension (p. 56)).

Student Classification Students are classified as full-time or part-time, as degree candidates or special students, and according to class standing. Students registered for a minimum of 12 hours a semester are classified as full-time. Those registered for fewer than 12 credit hours are classified as part-time. Degree candidates are those recognized by the College as pursuing studies leading to a baccalaureate degree at Maryville College. Special students are not recognized as degree candidates, though they do receive full credit for academic work completed with passing grades. The status of special student may be chosen by any student who does not plan to apply for a Maryville degree, or it may result from action of the College if the academic record does not warrant degree candidacy. Class standing is determined by the number of credit hours earned. The minimum requirements for class standings above the first-year level are as follows: For sophomore standing, 30 credit hours For junior standing, 60 credit hours For senior standing, 90 credit hours Transfer Credit Students who want to complete coursework at another accredited college or university in any academic term must obtain prior approval by the corresponding Division or Core Chair. A Transfer Credit Pre-Approval Form must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office no later than the end of classes in the semester before attendance at another institution begins. Unless courses are pre-approved, transfer credit cannot be guaranteed. Generally, academic courses in which the student has earned a grade of “C” or above will be transferred and applied toward graduation requirements.

Application for Leave of Absence for religious reasons is suitable for religious obligations that are of an extended character and that would make it impossible for a student to succeed during a semester. It is not given for recurring observances that take less than a semester to fulfill (such as, for example, Lent, Easter, Ramadan, or Eid) but for longer term obligations, such as pilgrimage or extended mission trips. Application for a Leave of Absence due to a military call to active duty is granted when accompanied by a copy of relevant military orders, at the time a student is required to stop attending classes. Other types of leaves may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Students returning from an approved Leave of Absence are not required to apply for readmission but instead need only submit a “return to campus” notification to the Registrar’s Office by April 1 for a Fall Semester return or November 1 for the following Spring Semester. Reinstatement is never guaranteed or automatic. The College reserves the right to require additional documentation that the student is qualified and ready to return. Decisions regarding financial aid are made separately from the reinstatement process. See Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence (ETLOA) (p. 62) for policy and procedures for granting a brief absence during the semester. Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence A student may be granted an Emergency Temporary Leave of Absence (ETLOA) for a period not to exceed two consecutive weeks at one time, within an academic semester. Each request will be reviewed on an individualized basis and may require appropriate documentation to support the request. Additional time may be granted, when medically indicated. Requests for an emergency temporary leave of absence will be reviewed and approved by the Vice President & Dean of Students and communicated to the Assistant Academic Dean for a specified period of time. An emergency temporary leave of absence may be applicable for students who must be absent for mental and/or physical health reasons, or any other personal or family emergency. Failure to attend classes by the return date specified on the emergency temporary leave of absence form may result in an administrative withdrawal from the College. Students are encouraged to consult with appropriate offices regarding the applicability of an emergency temporary leave of absence. Examples of such consultations may include, but are not limited to, conversations with the Title IX Coordinator, Disability Resources & Accessibility staff, Director of Prevention Education, Counseling Center staff, and/or academic advisor. Students may submit their request via email, by contacting the Dean of Students office during College business hours.",

Course Drop/Course Withdrawal If you are considering dropping or withdrawing from a course, the first step is to talk to your academic advisor or talk to the instructor. If you decide to drop or withdraw from a course, which process you follow depends on the timing. It is important to note that deciding not to attend class does not constitute a withdrawal from a course. Withdrawal is official on the day the Schedule Adjustment Form, properly signed, is returned by the student to the Registrar. Dropping a course – during the “Drop/Add” period at the beginning of the term When this applies: Within first 8 days of classes in fall or spring (Day 2 for 3-week terms, Day 3 for 5-week terms, Day 6 for 11-week terms) How to drop a course: Go into your Self Service account, drop the desired course, and submit it for advisor approval.

Be sure you understand all the impacts of a decision to withdraw from the College, including your academic timeline, financial/financial aid implications, your personal and professional future, and the readmission (p. 13) process. International students must discuss their intent to withdraw from the College with the Director of the Center for Global Engagement prior to initiating a withdrawal process. Should you decide during the year or at the close of the year to terminate enrollment at Maryville College, the withdrawal procedure is as follows: 1. Report to the Registrar’s Office (Fayerweather Hall, Room 148) to initiate the process. The Registrar’s Office will provide you with the link to the Intent to Withdraw Form. 2. Once you complete the Intent to Withdraw Form, the Financial Aid Office, Bursar’s Office, Residence Life Office, and other relevant campus offices will be notified. Students are responsible for any balances due after the withdrawal is processed. Students are responsible for any costs incurred by the College, including collection and litigation costs. Refunds (p. 15), when appropriate, will be processed as promptly as possible. Students who do not follow official withdrawal procedures may forfeit their deposit. Withdrawal from the College, voluntarily or involuntarily, requires residential students to abide by the official check- out procedures. Resident students should vacate the room and leave campus within twenty-four hours after the Intent to Withdraw is completed. Failure to do this will result in an “improper check-out fee.” If a student is unable to withdraw in person, they may do so by notifying the Registrar’s Office and the Office of Student Affairs in writing.

At Maryville College, the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree offers a broad-based program which is well suited for persons seeking a high degree of flexibility and greater interdisciplinary exploration. The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Music (B.M.) degrees are designed to provide students with deeper experience in a particular discipline or field. For specific careers or graduate programs, there may be a preference for the B.A., B.M., or the B.S. degree. Students should choose which degree to pursue based on their particular circumstances and goals. To receive the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music or the Bachelor of Science degree, the student must complete all requirements for that degree specified in the catalog in effect at the time of initial enrollment. For any of the three degrees, a minimum of 120 semester-hours of credit must be earned with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00. In addition, for all courses taken to satisfy major requirements for all degrees, a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00 must be earned in the major (2.75 for all educator preparation majors). The courses taken must satisfy all core, major, and major-related requirements. In addition, students must complete the Maryville College Works program as well as pass the English proficiency examination. Every candidate for a degree is expected to pursue his or her program of studies in residence at Maryville, especially in meeting general education and major requirements. If circumstances warrant, permission may be granted for non- resident credit. Approval of the appropriate academic division chairperson, Chair of Core Curriculum and the Registrar is required in advance. With rare exceptions, the following core curriculum domains must be completed by means of credit earned through Maryville College: U.S. Pluralism, Culture and Intercultural Dynamics, and Ethical Citizenship in the World. In addition, as a minimum, each degree candidate must complete at Maryville College 42 credit hours, including 20 in the senior year and nine in the major field. These credit hours must be earned in regular courses taught at the College and may not include internships, student teaching, or credit by examination. An exception to the senior year requirement is made for students in cooperative degree programs who spend the senior year in residence at the cooperating institution.

The goal of the program is to prepare students for lives of engaged professionalism by challenging them to investigate and explore future professional opportunities within the framework of the liberal arts tradition. Prominent features of the program are its emphasis on vocational discernment and career development and preparation as well as completion of a significant practical experience. These planned experiences may take the form of an internship, an approved semester of education abroad, an appropriate Senior Study, a semester of student teaching or another approved format. The program focuses on three over-arching student learning outcomes: 1. Students will acquire the knowledge to complete a personal vocation and career preparation and completion plan. 2. Students will participate in a significant practical experience. 3. Students will articulate how their educational Undergraduate Degree Requirements Undergraduate Degree Requirements| 67 experience and their significant practical experience apply to their professional opportunities. Students who transfer at least 45 credit hours are exempt from the requirement as are students completing dual degree programs in Biopharmaceutical Sciences, Biological Sciences with a Pre-Veterinary Tract, Nursing, and Engineering. These students may voluntarily participate in any or all program elements. The means by which the student learning outcomes are addressed and achieved are integrated into an incremental and cohesive program spanning four years that includes first-year seminars, disciplinary professional development courses, academic and career advising, learning modules related to career preparation, and a final reflection. Specific requirements for the program include: • Completion of a career-related career assessment and discussion of results with academic advisor. • Planning and engaging in a significant practical experience. • Completion of a career readiness educational program. • Submission of a final reflection. To satisfy this program, students will complete FYS 110, a 299/399 course, a 337 course, and MCW 400 course, or approved equivalents. Senior Study One of the distinctive features of a Maryville education is the Senior Study: The Undergraduate Research and Creative Expression Program of Maryville College. Every degree candidate completes such a project in the major field, under the guidance of a faculty supervisor.

Depending on the major field, Senior Study may account for three to six credit hours toward graduation. Other regulations governing Senior Study may be found in the Academic Procedures and Regulations (p. 41) section of this catalog. Placement Assessments First time, first year, and many transfer students take one or more placement assessments to ensure appropriate placement in course sequences. 1. Initial placement in mathematics is based on students’ ACT/SAT Math score and/or transcript. Students may then choose to complete an online math review and assessment to improve their placement. Students with an ACT score of 18 or below (SAT 510 or below) will be placed in Fundamentals Mathematics (MTH 105). Unless students demonstrate proficiency by testing out of this course, they must successfully complete MTH 105 before continuing in college-level mathematics or statistics. This course prepares students for college-level work and offers three institutional credits for satisfactory completion; the credits do not count toward the minimum needed for graduation. Regardless of standardized and placement test results, Maryville College accepts for credit those courses in the mathematical sciences taken through dual enrollment, AP, or IB (An AP exam score of 4 or 5 grants credit hours associated with course content – refer to the Advanced Placement (p. 13) section in this catalog). Dual enrollment courses must be passed with a grade of C or higher to receive transfer credit. 2. Students will receive a preliminary placement in composition based on their ACT English score or SAT Writing score. This placement may be adjusted in the following ways: a. Students with a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Examination in either English Language and Composition or English Literature and Composition earn credit for English 110: Composition and Speech I. b. Students with an AP score of 4 or 5 on both English Language and Composition and English Literature and Composition earn credit for ENG 110: Composition and Speech and ENG 160: Early Western Literature Tradition. c.

      "text": "Majors As a degree requirement, each student completes an approved program of concentrated study in a major field. The major is commonly taken in a single discipline, along with several courses in related subjects. Some majors are interdisciplinary. An individualized major may be designed, however, to meet particular educational needs (refer to the Individualized Major (p. 57) section in this Catalog). We also have dual degree programs (described below) that involve cooperative agreements with other accredited academic institutions, and degrees from both Maryville College and the cooperating institution are awarded. A disciplinary major consists of a minimum of 30 semester hours in a single discipline including three to six hours devoted to a Senior Study. In the B.A. and the B.S., the major may not require more than 50 hours in a single discipline (i.e. a single three-letter course designation). The B.A. involves a maximum of 56 hours in all major and related subjects. However, the educator preparation track within some majors may exceed the 56-hour limit because of the addition of professional courses. The B.S. involves a maximum of 70 hours in major and related courses. For an individualized major, possible only with the B.A. and B.S. degrees, at least 18 hours in one subject, 12 hours in a related subject, and six hours in Senior Study are required; approval of the Committee on Individualized Instruction must also be obtained. Students may select a major by the end of the first college year, but the selection may wait until the sophomore year in some fields. Postponement of the choice beyond the sophomore year, or a subsequent change of field, is likely to delay graduation beyond the normal four years. Students planning to pursue a major in a highly structured program, where the sequence of courses is an important consideration, are encouraged to confer with the appropriate academic division chair early in the first year of enrollment. Such fields include the foreign languages, natural sciences, mathematics, teacher education, physical education, and the cooperative programs in engineering and nursing. Permission of the academic division chair must be secured in order to major in any field. Approval must be registered on the proper form filed by the advisor with the College Registrar. Continuation in the major is contingent upon satisfactory academic performance. Substitutions for required major courses are granted only in rare instances and require the written approval of the division chair. For all courses taken to satisfy major requirements for all degrees, a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00 must be earned (2.75 for all educator preparation majors).",

The Maryville Curriculum, General Education Professor William Swann, Chair, Core Curriculum The Maryville Curriculum, a core program of general education, is based on the conviction that liberal learning is the best preparation for a satisfying and successful life, whatever one’s vocation. While many aspects of the college experience, including major-field requirements, allow students to prepare for a variety of careers and professions, general education emphasizes the cultivation of the intellectual skills and personal qualities that mark the educated person. Through the enhancement of skills and knowledge, the deepening of sensitivities, and the clarification of personal purpose, students learn to deal responsibly in a world of uncertainty and accelerating change. General education is the centerpiece of any liberal arts degree and provides curricular definition to the mission of a liberal arts college. The Maryville Curriculum follows directly and consciously from the College’s Statement of Purpose and Educational Goals. The Maryville Curriculum, often called the “core” curriculum, consists of 51 credit hours. Some general education requirements are met by virtue of the student’s major; others may be met by demonstration of competence. Course Descriptions for courses in the Maryville Curriculum are described in the Course Listings (p. 167) section of this Catalog. Distinctive features of the Maryville Curriculum: • Course groupings that are closely aligned with specified educational goals of the College. • An integrated and sequenced set of foundational courses designed to assist in adjustment to college life, to attend to the developmental and learning issues unique to first year students, and to develop the basic communication, quantitative, and critical thinking skills needed for success in college. • A range of coursework that provides grounding in the various modes of inquiry and all aspects of the liberal arts. • A range of choices for students among courses that fulfill common curricular goals. • Required groupings of courses designed to extend the college learning experience beyond the major and provide integration of liberal learning using various modes of inquiry. • Recognition that knowledge in certain domains is fulfilled by courses within the major. Undergraduate Degree Requirements| 75 • A strong global and cross-cultural dimension. • Attention to values and ethical decision-making throughout the curriculum, with a capstone course focusing on these matters.",

      "text": "Success in American Sign Language (ASL) and Deaf Studies or American Sign Language- English Interpreting requires being able to perceive signers’ faces, hand movements and body movements and being able to convey and receive ASL through these channels quickly at the natural pace of language. Also essential are ability to perceive and process visual information and eye-hand coordination that allow effective communication. A good foundation in basic ASL is critical to advancing successfully in the ASL and Deaf Studies major as well as the American Sign Language-English Interpreting major. American Sign Language-English Interpreting majors require good auditory perceptual skills as well as good visual skills when working between auditory and signed communications quickly and in real time. One exception is that Deaf people who want to become Deaf interpreters are encouraged to apply to the American Sign Language- English Interpreting program. Such interpreters are often intermediary interpreters who work between signed communications. The major goal of the program is to prepare graduates for entry-level professional interpretation and transliteration assignments between ASL and spoken English, contact varieties, and English-influenced sign forms and Spoken English, respectively. Students successfully completing the program of study will have achieved the following learning outcomes: 1. Students will perform entry-level interpreting work in a variety of contexts through a practicum experience. 2. Students will demonstrate knowledge of types of settings, language styles, and factors that impact communication. 3. Students will demonstrate knowledge about the history of interpreting, theoretical frameworks, and current trends on a standardized exam. 4. Students will determine their role in essential communities, provide a skills profile, develop a self- care plan, and discuss their philosophy of interpreting. 5. Students will demonstrate preparedness for professional aspects, identify ways to continue professional growth, and demonstrate knowledge and application of the RID Code of Professional Conduct. 6.

Program Coordinator Our Mission We foster professional educators to intentionally impact individuals, groups, and communities of the world. Program Overview The Division of Education at Maryville College has a long and proud tradition of preparing educators who demonstrate and promote excellence in teaching and learning, within the context of a liberal arts institution. The Division of Education houses the Master of Arts in Teaching Secondary STEM and the Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education. Education faculty collaborate with multiple divisions to provide initial licensure in ten P/K-12 and 6-12 content areas. The Educator Preparation Program at Maryville College is continually refined to meet the State of Tennessee’s licensure requirements for teachers. As a result, modifications in programs and curriculum may occur. Those interested in becoming a teacher should meet with an advisor in the Educator Preparation Program as soon as possible. Secondary and P/K-12 licensure candidates are co-advised by an advisor in the Educator Preparation Program. Students are encouraged to discuss the educator preparation program and teacher licensure requirements with their advisors on a regular basis since the Tennessee State Board of Education may act on teacher licensure matters not addressed in the Catalog. Educator Preparation Professional Characteristics It is the responsibility of all students seeking teacher licensure to develop and maintain professional behaviors, characteristics, and dispositions that are associated with professional educators. These essential dispositions include self-regulation, grooming/appearance, relationships, professionalism, cultural awareness, integrity, affect, respect, communication, and reflection. Candidates are expected to demonstrate essential dispositions throughout the program of study not only in coursework, teaching practice, professional activities, and student teaching, but also in personal interactions with students, families, colleagues, and communities.",

This arrangement allows the student to earn two degrees, one from Maryville College and one from the engineering school. The first three years are spent at Maryville, completing Maryville College’s general education requirements and the courses necessary for further study in engineering or applied science; the remaining time, normally two years, is spent at an accredited school of engineering. Maryville College has formal dual-degree arrangements with Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, Tennessee, the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. Maryville College will honor the dual-degree arrangement with other regionally accredited institutions if the student is able to make transfer arrangements.",

      "text": "After approximately four years of study, which include 92 semester hours from Maryville College and 28 semester hours (with grades of “C” or better) from the engineering school, the student will receive the Bachelor of Arts degree from the College. When all requirements for the engineering degree have been met, usually by the end of the fifth year of study, the engineering school will award the Bachelor of Science degree in the area of specialization. The second degree may be earned in over a dozen engineering fields, as well as in the applied sciences, depending on the university that the student attends. Maryville students enroll in the engineering school as transfer students. The College’s Dual-Degree program coordinator assists the students in both selecting an engineering school and in the transfer process. The decision to admit rests with the cooperating university, not with Maryville College. Admission to some engineering fields is very competitive, reflecting high demand for places in an entering class. Students successfully completing the program of study will have achieved the following learning outcomes: 1. Communicate mathematical ideas with precision and clarity in both written and oral form. 2. Develop expertise in appropriate technology for desired career path. 3. Understand and apply mathematical concepts in both theoretical and applied areas. 4. Model real-world problems, abstract real-world problems into the appropriate math world, solve problems mathematically, translate the math answers into real-world terms, and evaluate the correctness and validity of the answers. 5. Experience the application of mathematics to other disciplines through appropriate related courses. Any student interested in pursuing the dual-degree option is urged to consult the Dual-Degree Coordinator in the Division of Mathematics and Computer Science as early in the first year as possible. The program is highly structured, and most of the courses are part of a sequence. For that reason, the course of study must be carefully planned to ensure that all general education and major requirements are met during the three years spent at Maryville.

Mathematics is even more vital to liberal education today, when every citizen must be equipped with the quantitative skills needed to navigate our technological and data-driven world. The increasing demand for well- trained professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields is well- documented, and all of these require knowledge of mathematics. The curriculum in mathematics develops a student’s ability to think analytically and construct logical arguments, building a foundation to support advanced study in mathematics, but also providing a gateway to the expansive, diverse career opportunities in the mathematical sciences.",

Philosophy, which literally means the “love of wisdom,” lies at the heart of a liberal arts education because it asks students to question, explore, and pursue truth wherever it may lead. In philosophy, rigor, honesty, and humility are requisite to exploring questions about reality and truth, justice and morality, life and death, language and culture, society and politics, and God and the meaning of existence. Students who major or minor in philosophy learn to think and write critically and to read and analyze texts carefully. Such skills are excellent preparations for professions in law, politics, business, education, ministry, and medicine.",

Nevertheless, the study of Spanish does not simply involve language acquisition vis-à-vis classroom instruction; the acquisition of a language requires intellectual engagement through the study of the various cultures and histories of the peoples 148| Maryville College Academic Catalog 2025-2026 who claim Spanish as their native tongue. The members of the Spanish faculty are dedicated to facilitating the acquisition and understanding of this modern language in a practical fashion and in a variety of settings such as serving in an internship in the general community and, for students eligible to travel abroad, via a study abroad experience in a Spanish-speaking country. In addition, students of Spanish are expected to increase second language proficiency—oral, aural, and written—via exposure to and academic engagement with a variety of media be it literary, film, historical, or professional (journalism, business, etc.). These media challenge students to question their perception of the various Hispanic cultures and to engage in critical inquiry that leads to a wider understanding of the world.
